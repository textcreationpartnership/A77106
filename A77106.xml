         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170342:4"/>maiſt plainly ſee, the degrees and ſteps, which occaſioned the fall and untimely end of that great, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was the rather encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hereunto, by the ſad complaint of Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> eldeſt Brother to the Late King, which was, <hi>That the Engliſh Nation, being inferiour to none for praiſe-worthy Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet were ſurpaſt by all, in remitting their praiſe-worthy Actions to poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Compiling this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
<pb facs="tcp:170342:4"/>I have kept cloſe to the naked truth, without the leaſt reflection upon any Party or Intereſt, and that in as few words, as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, not omitting any thing conſiderable, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Readers taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p>His whole Raign was full of mutations and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; For it is with times, as it is with wayes, ſome are more rough and ſteep, others more ſmooth and level; or rather may they be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſea, which is now calm and ſmooth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb facs="tcp:170342:5"/>boyſterous waves and ſurgies are only prevalent; the truth of both are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and freſh in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of many of the different Raigns of King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles;</hi> the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtilly indulgent to his own eaſe, had entayled an empty Exchequer upon the latter, which in humane probability was the occaſion of the ſad breaches and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, that happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his Subjects. There is a naturall deſire in all mankind ſince the fall, to know good and evil; and it
<pb facs="tcp:170342:5"/>is as naturall to moſt men, to pry into the ſecrets of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and the more Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces endeavour to conceal their thoughts, the more the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple labour to divine them; and when people are moſt in the dark, they fain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the clearest light, and take the preſumption to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure raſhly the intentions of Princes; as when the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt fell on <hi>Sejanus</hi> his head, the vulgar and moſt ignorant of the people boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they fore-ſaw the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; Therefore it is beſt to Take S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Whilſt he abode in <hi>Scotland</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Count <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ardmannoth,</hi> and was the ſixt of <hi>January</hi> 1604. in preſence of all the Lords of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and other Peeres of the Realme, at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Created Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with all uſuall and accuſtomed ſolemnities.</p>

            <p> Count <hi>Gundamore</hi> being ſent over Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to treate of a Match betwixt the young Prince and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who confidently affirmed, there was no other way to regaine the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to ſettle a perpetual Peace in <hi>England,</hi> but by this Match.</p>
            <p>King. <hi>James</hi> having a naturall inclination to peace, gives great attention, and by advice of the Privy Councell, the Prince on the 17 of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1622. is ſent diſguiſed with the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> attended by <hi>Endimion Porter,</hi> of the Bed-Chamber, and <hi>Richard Greenham,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe to the Duke, who were met at <hi>Dover</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Cottington,</hi> Secretary to the Prince, who being Imbarqued, Land at <hi>Boloigne,</hi> and ſo poſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſtaying one day, he had a tranſient View of that excellent Lady the Princes <hi>Henerettae Maria,</hi> at a Mask, <hi>which The Great Diſpoſer of all things had preſerved for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> he arrives at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and alighted at the Earle of <hi>Briſtolls</hi> houſe, then extraordinary Ambaſſadour, whoſe ſuddaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall ſtartled <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> who was altogether a ſtranger to the Journey.</p>
            <p>The next Morning notice was given to Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> favourite (and by him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to King <hi>Philip</hi>) of the arrivall of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who in private informed the King of the Princes hazardous adventure to have a ſight of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> which accordingly was afterwards performed with a great deale of ſeeming affection. But the crafty <hi>Spaniard</hi> could by no means be drawne to admit the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but would reſerve it as a

            <p>Much time was ſpent, and Articles were drawn on both ſides ready to ſigne, when on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> dies, who was to give his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the Match; application is made to Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> which protracted much time: the Prince being ſenſible of delay, deſires leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, &amp; with many Complements takes his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of the King and <hi>Infanta,</hi> and with much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger arrives the fiſt of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Porchmouth,</hi> the next day poſts to <hi>London,</hi> where he was received with unſpeakable joy of the people, and ſoone after haſts to <hi>Royſton,</hi> where the King then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; to whom he gave an ample and large account of the whole proceedings: the King communicates it to the Councell, who concluded to acquaint a Parliament with it, and forthwith a Parliament was ſummoned to meet in <hi>February</hi> following. Which being met, he declared <hi>the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a mutuall compliance betwixt a King and his Parliament; urging it with the parallel of Chriſt and his Church, the husband &amp; the wife; and ſo falls upon the buſineſſe, giving a ſhort account of his Sons going to</hi> Spaine, <hi>with</hi> Buckingham <hi>to attend him, and his endeavours therein for the peace and welfare of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>and deſires their advice and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the good of the Common-wealth, Religion, his Son, his Children of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>how that his Eſtate and welfare conſiſted with theirs, and that he was free to follow their advice; and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſerious and Chriſtian Proteſtations, that never wayfaring man in the burning deſarts more deſired water to quench his thirſt, then he thirſted and longed for the happy ſucceſſe of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

            <p> The Houſe after debate deſired a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the particulars, which accordingly was performed by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buckingham</hi> having ſatisfied the curioſity of a ſearching Parliament, was by them greatly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and looked upon as the preſerver of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Parliament after nature Conſideration, adviſe the King to break off the Treaty, and to proclaim open warre; the King being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a peacefull diſpoſition, was very timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it, and urges his great <hi>want of money to maintaine it, the Exchequer being much drained by his Sons Journey into</hi> Spaine, <hi>Ambaſſadours, the maintenance of his Children abroad, who eate no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread but by him; beſides, he was loath to ſhew his Teeth, and could not bite; he is willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Treaties, but if he ſhould begin a warre, God onely knows when it will end, but he would ingage his Son for the Recovery of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>and in his old age will, if need require, aſſiſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, promiſing the diſpoſall of the moneys to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forthwith a Councell of War is choſen, who order 6000 men to be ſent immediately into the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> in order to their paſſage into <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Buckingham</hi> is accuſed of treaſon by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, but nothing came of it.</p>
            <p>The Prince growing in yeares, and in the favour of the people, the Treaty with <hi>Spaine</hi> being null'd, ſome overtures are made for a Match with the Princes <hi>Henneretta Maria,</hi> the youngeſt ſiſter of the <hi>French</hi> King; King <hi>James</hi> breaks it to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170342:11"/>Councell, which joyntly applaud it, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſummoned, and the buſineſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, it was entertained by them with an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent, and propoſed that an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour be forth with ſent to negotiate in behalfe of the Match; the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> is with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition ſent to feele the pulſe of the <hi>French</hi> King, in whom he found a ready inclination, ſo that he could eaſily gueſſe at the event; having advertiſed his Majeſty of it, inſtantly the Earle of <hi>Carlile</hi> is ſent as an additionall Ambaſſadour to the Earle of <hi>Holland;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King ſends Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe <hi>D'Effait</hi> for, <hi>England</hi> in the quality of an Ambaſſadour; the Noble Inſtruments plyed their buſineſſe ſo cloſe, that on the tenth of <hi>November</hi> 1624. Articles on both ſides were ſigned, &amp; there wanted nothing for the Compleating the Match, but a diſpenſation from <hi>Rome,</hi> for which the King of <hi>France</hi> ſollicited.</p>
            <p>In the Interim King <hi>James</hi> being moleſted with a tertian Ague, which drave him into a Feaver, delivers up his ſoule to God the 27 of <hi>March</hi> 1625. at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> leaving his three Kingdomes to his Son.</p>
            <p>Various rumours paſt among the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a plaiſter which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> cauſed to be laid to the Kings wriſts; but his Phyſitians, Sir <hi>Matthew Liſter,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Chambers,</hi> and others, being examined, cleared the Duke of that ſcandall.</p>
            <p>He was accounted and called <hi>Great Britaines Solomon,</hi> by ſome Courtiers; a Generall Scholler, and made all his Studies and Learning ſubſervient to that of Divinity.</p>
            <p>He was a perfect hater of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi>

            <p>The ſad Newes of King <hi>James</hi> his death came to <hi>Whitehall</hi> juſt when Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was in his Sermon, which made him to breake off in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the ſadneſſe of the Congregation.</p>
            <p>His Son <hi>Charles</hi> was immediately proclaimed at the Court Gate, <hi>King of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland,</hi> who preſently, diſpatcheth aviſo's of his Fathers death to all Confederate Princes and States to Next he took care for the ſolemne Interring of the Royall Corps, which on the 14 of <hi>May</hi> was performed with all funerall Rites; his Statue was lively preſented on a magnificent Heare, King <hi>Charles</hi> being preſent thereat. His funerall Sermon was preached by Dr <hi>Williams</hi> Lord Keeper and Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> (by his death) had intailed a war and an empty Exchequer upon his Succeſſour, which in all humane probability was the occaſion of the great differences and vaſt breaches betwixt him and the people.</p>
            <p>The King, though much poſſeſt with griefe, yet there remained ſome part for love, he had ſtill an eye toward <hi>France,</hi> and to manifeſt it, he ſent out Letters of procuration to the Duke <hi>Chevereux</hi> to Eſpouſe the Lady <hi>Heneretta Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> which Eſpouſalls were ſolemnly performed in the Church of <hi>Noſtredam</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170342:12"/>with divers other Gentlemen of quality, were ſent to attend her: At <hi>Bulloigne</hi> ſhe was attended with one and twenty Ships, and divers Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and on Sunday the 12 of <hi>Jane</hi> 1625. ſhe landed at <hi>Dover;</hi> the King then lay at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and the next day met her at <hi>Dover,</hi> whence with all ſolemnity ſhe was conducted to <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi>-Houſe in <hi>London,</hi> where a Chappel was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her devotion, with a Covent adjoyning of Capuchin Fryers, according to the Articles of Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London</hi> at that time was much viſited with the Contagion, which broke out under the ſame roof that it formerly did at King <hi>James</hi> his Initiation into the Government; and that which is more remarkable, on the ſame day.</p>
            <p>The King was not altogether Rapt up with the enjoyment of his deare Conſort, but he was mindfull of the affaires of State; ſummons a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which being met, he ſpeaks to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

            <p>This Speech I ſet downe at large, it being the firſt, and I think not Inferiour to any for Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</p>
            <p>Though this Speech conſiſted of very preſſing Arguments, yet the Parliament made but ſlow haſt; for they had two Petitions, one for <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the other for <hi>Grievances:</hi> which were <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented</hi> to King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>last Seſſion,</hi> but received no <hi>anſwer:</hi> which Petitions were preſented to the King with this pretence, that he might have time to conſider and give a deliberate anſwer.</p>

            <p>The King taking notice of the ſmall appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Houſe by reaſon of the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Adjourn'd the Parliament to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Parliament met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they preſented his Majeſty a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Recuſants, which the King readily and freely aſſented to.</p>
            <p>The King urgeth the ſpeedy Contributions, which cauſed great debates, ſome were very free and willing, others were backward, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the buſineſſe was managed with green heads,

               <hi>February</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1625. was the day appointed for the Kings Coronation, which was performed with all uſuall and accuſtomed ſolemnity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his paſſage through <hi>London,</hi> which ſaved ſome money, the Exchequer being low.</p>
            <p>A Parliament was called, and met the 6 of <hi>Feb.</hi> the Commons began where they left, concerning <hi>Religion;</hi> the Lords preſent the King with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning <hi>Grievances</hi> of their order. The King promiſed ſpeedy redreſſe. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>The King being ſenſible of the neceſſities of the Kingdome, demands ſupply, and by Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Weston</hi> tells them, <hi>That the Fleete was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, victualls ſpent, and the men in great neceſſity for want of pay, for which they were ready to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which would be of dangerous conſequence; and that there were</hi> 40 <hi>ſale ready to goe out, which want a preſent ſupply; that the Army on the Sea-coaſt wants victualls, and clothes, with other preſſing wants and neceſſities.</hi> In ſtead of a ſupply M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Coke,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, Inſolently delivers this; <hi>It is better to die by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Enemy, then to be deſtroy'd at home.</hi> The King being adviſed of it, was ſenſibly troubled at it, ſends Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> to require ſatisfaction, but they made very ſlow haſt in it, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd him to ſummon both Houſes together, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170342:15"/>by the Lord Keeper delivers his mind in part to them in a large Speech (much in vindication of the Duke) which being ended, the King ſpake as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I muſt withall put you in mind of times paſt, you may remember my Father mov'd by your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and woune by your perſwaſion, brake the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In theſe perſwaſions I was your Inſtrument to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and I was glad to be Inſtrumentall in any thing which might pleaſe the whole body of the Realme; nor was there any one then in greater favour then this man whom you now traduce, and now when you find me ſo far intangled in war, that I have no honourable nor ſafe retreate; you make my neceſſity your priviledge, and ſet what rate you pleaſe upon your ſupplyes, a practice not very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward Kings: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> Coke <hi>told you it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die by a forraine Enemy, then to be deſtroy'd at home. Indeed I thinke it is more honourable for a King to be invaded and almost deſtroy'd by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Enemy, then to be diſpiſed at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commons nothing ſtartled at this, made a quick reply concerning the Remonſtrance, the King would have them to diſpatch buſineſſe of greater concernment, and there would be time enough for that. But the Houſes thought nothing of more concernment, then proceeding againſt the <hi>Duke;</hi> which gave occaſion to the Lord <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> who long'd for nothing more then to exhibit 12 Articles againſt the Duke: The Duke being wary and vigilant, had long before provided Articles againſt <hi>Digby,</hi> though wanting one of the others number, which the next day were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Many rejoyced at it, that by their quarrelling
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170342:15"/>truth was diſcovered, and they were ſo equally matcht, that it was hard to diſcover which had the better of it. But it reſted not here, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few dayes the Commons drew up 13 Articles againſt the Duke, &amp; preſented them to the Lords, and ſent a meſſage, deſiring he might be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Sir <hi>Dudly Digs,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Eliot,</hi> two principall. Actors in the Charge, were ſerit to the Tower. The Houſe Remonſtrate to the King, upon which they were diſcharg'd; the Duke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made his defence, deliver'd it to the Lords, who ſequeſtred him from ſitting till the tryall was over.</p>
            <p>The defence was expreſt with a great deale of humility and modeſty. But the Commons having gon ſo far, were reſolved to bring it to an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, drew up a Declaration, to back it before the ſubſidyes, at which the King being much Incenſt, the next day, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1626. he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Houſe; ſome interceding for ſome time, he replyed, <hi>No not a minute.</hi> That very day was the Earle of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> committed to the Tower; and Proclamation for burning all Copyes of the Commons Declaration before their diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The breaking up of the Parliament was by ſome charg'd upon the Kings Indulgence toward the Duke.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> pretending a martiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Vatoline,</hi> craved of King <hi>James</hi> his ayd, at whoſe requeſt the King promiſed to lend the <hi>Vantgard,</hi> a gallant Ship of the Navy Royall; the Merchants on ſatisfaction to lend 6 more. The <hi>Rotchellers</hi> being moſt <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> on pretence that the King had not ſlighted For <hi>Lewis,</hi> according to agreement, and taking
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170342:16"/>the advantage of the Advance of the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for <hi>Italy,</hi> ſurprized the Iſle of <hi>Rhe,</hi> together with many Ships that were in the Harbour. King <hi>Lewis</hi> underſtanding of it, makes what warlike preparation poſſibly he could, requires ayd of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> to performe his Fathers promiſe, lends the Ships to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, fall on <hi>Subize</hi> the <hi>Staſiarch,</hi> the chiefe Rebell, retaketh his ſtrong Holds, and chaſeth him to the Iſle of <hi>Oleron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> being ſenſible of his Brothers miſ-implying his Ships, ſent to demand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of them; who anſwered that his ſubjects detained them contrary to his mind, and that he might get them as he could. The King, not being ſatisfied with this demand, and wifely foreſeeing it might occaſion a further breach, looks home, and finds the <hi>French</hi> who attended the Queene, very inſolent, who Impoſed on the Queene a ſtrange kinde of penance, <hi>viz. That ſhe ſhould goe barefoot from Somerſet-Houſe to Tyburn Gallowes, to offer up her prayers for Prieſts and Jeſuits there executed for treaſon.</hi> For which the King was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſcontented, and on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1626. he came to <hi>Somerſet</hi>-Houſe, attended by the Duke, and diverſe Officers of State, (all the Queens ſervants and attendants being the day before ſummoned to attend) he ſpake as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

               <hi>The occaſion of that meeting was a complaint made in the lower Houſe for ſtaying ſome merchants goods, for denying Tunnage and Poundage, which difference might be ſoon decided, were his words and actions rightly underſtood; for if he did not take theſe duties as appendixes to his hereditary prerogative, and had declared he chalenged them not of right, and onely deſired to enjoy them by the gift of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, why did they not paſſe the Bill as they promiſed to him, to clear his by-past actions and future procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, eſpecially in this his time of ſo great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore he did now expect they ſhould make good what they promiſed, and put an end to all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons emergent to their delay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Committees were appointed, one for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the other for civil affairs; that for Religion report, <hi>that upon due inſpection they find it in a very tottering and declining condition:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other report,</hi> that many marchants had had their goods ſeiſed for not <hi>paying the cuſtomes of Tunnage and Poundage, being then against the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right and priviledge of Parliament; for which S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jo. Worſham, M. Daws, M. Carmarthen,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170342:20"/>Farmers of the Cuſtomes, were required to give an account. The King <hi>intervenes,</hi> and tels the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that what they did was as men addicted to his command, neither were they commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take it as a due debt, but he preſumed the Parliament would performe their large profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and grant it <hi>by bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They replyed the Farmers did it without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the warrant being only to levy and collect, not to ſeize; for the Bill they deſired his pardon, being to inſiſt on matters of Religion firſt.</p>
            <p>The King requeſts them to forbeare proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe men, and intimated that what they did was by his warrant. The Houſe in great diſcontent adjourned for ſome few dayes, and being met again, they reſolved upon a Remonſtrance, which the Speaker refuſing to read, and offering to riſe, <hi>Mr. Hollis</hi> held him, and ſwore he ſhould fit there ſo long as they pleaſed; which not prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> read theſe enſuing Articles as the Proteſtation of the Houſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whoſoever ſhould bring in Innovation of Religion, or by favour ſeek to introduce Popery, or Arminianiſm, or other opinions diſagreeing from the true and orthodox Church, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a Capitall enemy to the Kingdome and Common wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall councell or adviſe the taking and levying the ſubſidies of Tunnage and Poundage, not being granted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſhall be an actor or inſtrument therein, ſhall be reputed a Caitall enemy to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170342:20"/> 3. <hi>If any man ſhall voluntarily yeild or pay the ſaid Subſidies of Tunnage and Poundage, not being granted by Parliament, he ſhall be reputed a beirayer of the Liberties-of</hi> England, <hi>and an enemy to the Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which the Houſe gave a great ſhout.</p>
            <p>The King adviſed of it, ſent the Uſher of the blacke rod to diſſolve the Parliament who would not be admitted; Sir <hi>Miles Hobert</hi> lockt the door. The King incenſed at their contempt, ſent for the Captain of the <hi>Penſioners</hi> and <hi>the Guard</hi> to force a paſſage, the members fearing the iſſue, <hi>ſlunk away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King went preſently into the Houſe of Lords, and delivered his mind as followeth.</p>

                  <p>I never came here upon ſo unpleaſing an occaſion, it-being the diſſolution of a Parliament; therefore you may have ſome cauſe to wonder why I ſhould not rather chooſe to doe this by Commiſſion, it being a generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of Kings to leave harſh commands to their Ministers, themſelves onely Executing pleaſing things; yet conſidering that Justice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts as well in reward and praiſe of vertue, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of vice, I thought it neceſſary to come here to day, to declare to you, and all the world, that it was meerely the undutifull and ſeditious carriage of the Lower Houſe, that hath made the diſſolution of this Parliament; and you my Lords, are ſo far from being cauſes of it, that I take as much comfort in your dutifull demeanour, as I am juſtly diſtaſted with their proceedings: yet to avoyd miſtakings, Let me tell you, that it is ſo far from me to adjudge all that Houſe guilty, that I know there are many

                  <p>To conclude, as theſe Vipers muſt look for their reward of puniſhment; ſo you, my Lords, muſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect from me that favour and protection that a good King oweth to his loving and dutifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

            <p>The Queen being affrighted, was before her time delivered of a Son, who was baptized <hi>Charles,</hi> which lived not above two houres.</p>

            <p>Two great Reaſons were given for the Kings ſuddaine conſent to a peace; the one was the ill ſucceſſe and bad fortune that alwayes attended his warlike deſignes; the other and maine, the ſinews of war being dried and ſhrunk up, the Exchequer was very barren.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Reuben,</hi> the famous Painter of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> came over into <hi>England,</hi> and made overtures of a peace with <hi>Spaine,</hi> by offering the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> (then which nothing was more deſirable of the King) but he had not full power to performe.</p>
            <p>On the 29 of <hi>May</hi> 1630. the Queen was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of her ſecond Son, who was baptized the 27 of <hi>June</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>The King being deeply ſenſible of his brothers miſeries, and being informed of a Diet at <hi>Ratſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> ſent Sir <hi>Robert Anſtruther</hi> Ambaſſadour to

            <p>One <hi>Layton,</hi> a Rigid Presbyter, who publiſhed a book, call'd <hi>Zions Plea,</hi> (in which he excited the Parliament and People to kill all the Biſhops.

            <p>The Peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> was at laſt concluded, the Articles being the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, with thoſe that were betwixt King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, excepting that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould diſpoſe of all his Intereſt in the Emperour toward the reſtitution of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> which was proclaimed Sunday the 27 of <hi>November</hi> 1630. with Great ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aprill</hi> the 25. 1631. <hi>Mervin,</hi> Lord <hi>Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> Earle of <hi>Caſtle-Haven,</hi> was arraigned at the Kings-Bench.

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1633.

            </list>
            <p>Which though backt with a Letter, requiring exact obedience, the Deane durſt not performe, for feare of diſcontenting the people.</p>
            <p>The King by the Advice of the Biſhops and Councell, Reviv'd his Fathers Declaration for tolerating Lawfull Sports on the Sunday, which gave great diſtaſt to the people, eſpecially to the puritanicall party.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond of <hi>February</hi> being <hi>Candlemas</hi> day at night, the King and Queene were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at <hi>White Hall</hi> with a Mask of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Inns of Court; The like was never in <hi>England</hi> ſeene before for State and Magnificence; and afterward were Royally entertained by the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with a ſtately Feaſt and Banquet.</p>
            <p>1634. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt was much perplext with Pirates of ſeverall Nations, and the Kings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170342:23"/>Dominion in the narrow Seas evidently uſurped by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and defended by <hi>Grotius</hi> in his book, Entituled, <hi>Mare Liberum;</hi> which was exactly Anſwered by the Learned <hi>Selden</hi> in his Book, Entituled, <hi>Mare Clauſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Exchequer at that time was very much drained: The King having tyed himſelfe up by granting the Petition of Right, could not tax or levy money without conſent of Parliament, and how to expect it from them, with whom he had parted ſo fouly, he could not imagine. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Intentions to his Attorney <hi>Noy,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Neceſſity of rayſing money, but deſires it to be done Legally, who after much ſtudy and paines finds out an ancient preſident of raiſing a Tax for ſetting forth a Navy in caſe of danger without a Parliament. The King was very glad of it, Writs were Inſtantly Iſſued out to the Sea-port Townes, to raiſe money for a certaine number of Ships well provided, for the ſafety of the Nation: they complained that it equally concern'd the whole Nation; upon which a Tax was laid throughout the whole Kingdome, every one endeavoured to excuſe it; and ſome alledged it was againſt the Petition of Right, it being done out of Parliament, which begat a great quarrell.</p>
            <p>Great Conteſt happened in <hi>Ireland</hi> this yeare between the Proteſtants and Papiſts; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> then Lord Deputy to ſummon a Parliament, for the rayſing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, for the payment of the Army, and the Kings Revenue, which was managed with ſo much wiſdome and prudence by the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he obtained his deſire.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170342:24"/>
            <p> There was likewiſe a Synod called, wherein the Articles of 1615 were repealed, and the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſhed in their room: they did likewiſe unanimouſly declare their conſent and agreement with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the profeſſion of the ſame Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> were now Hatching miſchievous deſignes againſt the King, which they colour'd with ſpecious pretences; as, <hi>The Kings endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Intrench on their Liberties,</hi> and after ſome time were ſo Inſolent as to charge the King <hi>with favouring of Papiſts,</hi> in a deſperate Libell, which by the care and diligence of the Lords of the Councell was ſuppreſt: the Author was diſcovered to be one <hi>Hagge,</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall abettor the Lord <hi>Bellamore,</hi> who being found Guilty, received the ſentence of death, but upon his application to the Kings mercy was pardoned.</p>
            <p>The 29 of <hi>September</hi> (by the procurement of the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi>) one <hi>Robert Parr</hi> aged 160) was brought to <hi>London,</hi> one of the wonders of this laſt age.</p>

            </p>
            <p>On the 28 of <hi>December</hi> 1635. was borne the Kings ſecond Daughter, and was the ſecond of <hi>January</hi> baptized <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

               <hi>Bastwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> three violent and reſtleſſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men, were ſentenc'd in the High Commiſſion Court, for ſeditious and ſcandalous Libells, by them made and diſperſt againſt the Biſhops, and their Eccleſiaſtical Government; which ſentence was by ſome accounted harſh and ſevere.</p>
            <p>The King knowing the neceſſity of a mutuall Compliance in matters of Religion, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Fathers Intention in compoſing a Liturgy for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Orders the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with diverſe other Biſhops of both Nations, to reviſe and correct, as they ſhould think meete, the Service, Compiled in his Fathers life time, (which very little differ'd from that of <hi>England</hi>) orders it to be ſent to the Councell in <hi>Scotland</hi> to be made uſe of.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170342:25"/>
            <p> When on the 23 of <hi>July</hi> 1637: the Dean of <hi>Edenborough</hi> began to read the Book in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Giles</hi> Church, a ſuddain uproar began by the women and baſer ſort of people; The Biſhop appointed to preach goes into the Pulpit, hoping to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their Irreverend Carriage, which nothing prevailed, for they were the more Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, flinging ſtones, ſtooles, and what ever elſe came next to hand, ſo that he hardly eſcaped with life.</p>
            <p>Diverſe other Churches were likewiſe Infeſted with the like fury and madneſſe; but by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Archbiſhop of St <hi>Andrews,</hi> Lord Chancelour, and other Magiſtrates, the tumult was appeaſed, ſome were afterward apprehended, and endeavours made to finde out the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner.</p>
            <p>But it reſted not here, for not long after it was obſerved, that a great concourſe of people from all parts of that Kingdome came to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> which occaſioned the Lords of the Councell to put forth ſeverall Proclamations to prevent the like diſorders; but they nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; for the next day the Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> going to the Councell, was followed by a great multitude, railing and reviling him, untill he came to the Councell-doore, where he was no ſooner enter'd, but they beſet the Houſe with very great multitudes, threatning deſtruction to all that were within. The Councell immediately require ayde of the Provoſt and other Magiſtrates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who returne anſwer, that they were in the like danger. The tumult ſtill increaſing, they of the City were forc't for the ſafegard of their own lives to ſubſcribe as followeth.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Which being ſigned, the Councell thought was a good ſtep to ſuppreſſe the tumult, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the High ſtreet, The Lord Treaſurer and other Lords were afreſh aſſaulted, trodden under-foote, and brought back by violence to the Councell-Houſe, where being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they require ayde of diverſe Noblemen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the Common-prayer-book, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed what aſſiſtance they poſſibly could, and in the end return'd home ſafe.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon proclamation was made at the croſſe of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> for prevention of the like diſorders, but to ſmal effect; ſome Citizens demanding the reſtitution of the Miniſters, and the performance of what was ſubſcribed.</p>
            <p>Suddenly two petitions were preſented againſt the Common-prayer book, and the Compoſers and Abettors of it, which petitions were ſent to the King (with the narrative of the whole) who immediatly ſent inſtructions for adjourning the Tearm to <hi>Sterling</hi> a ſtrong place, and to make proclamation of ſevere penalties to be inflicted on the breakers and contemners of the peace; which was no ſooner proclaimed, but the Lord <hi>Hume, Lindſey</hi> and divers others proteſt againſt it, and in contempt of Authority, compeld the Heralds to hear the Proteſt, or Covenant read, all which being imparted to the King, he ſends
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170342:26"/>Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> as high Commiſſioner, to ſettle peace, and a right underſtanding, who dealt treacherouſly and deceitfully, trifling away eleven moneths time, having three times returned to and again for <hi>England,</hi> and at laſt publiſhed the Kings gracious Proclamation, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Service book, and high Commiſſion, promiſing an Aſſembly to be held at <hi>Glaſcow, Novem.</hi> 21. 1638. and a Parliament at <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> the 15. of <hi>May</hi> 1639, but this nothing ſatisfied, for the more the King granted, the more averſe they were.</p>
            <p>During the treaty the Covenanters had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Officers, Armes, and what was neceſſary for a war. The General Aſſembly being met, they proceed to declare againſt the Book of Common prayer, which occaſioned the Biſhops to draw up a proteſt againſt their proceedings, and in concluſion by the Unanimous conſent of all the Councel, excepting <hi>Argile,</hi> the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was diſſolved. Proclamation was made and publiſhed throughout the Nation, ſhewing the grounds and reaſons of their diſſolution, which proclamation was oppoſed by the Covenanters, with a proteſtation to adhere to all their former Covenants to put by all the Biſhops: Some they excommunicate, and not long after totally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Epiſcopacy, as being (as they pretended) inconſiſtant with the word of God and Lawes of that Nation. Which occaſioned the Marqueſſe and Commiſſioners to returne for <hi>England</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly much diſcontented.</p>
            <p>In the interim the Covenanters began to raiſe Armes, Levy ſouldiers, Impoſe taxers upon the people, ſeize ſome of the Kings Caſtles, raiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170342:27"/>and prepare for a war, and choſe <hi>David Leſley</hi> an old ſouldier to be General.</p>
            <p>Toward the latter end of <hi>October</hi> 1638. came the queen mother into <hi>England,</hi> many of the Common people were troubled at it, as being generally by them lookt upon as a forerunner of a greater miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are very high and inſolent, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all authority, and invent new and unheard of Judicatures in defiance to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; and having caſt of Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the Calviniſtical presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which for a long time had bin hatching in that Kingdome, but could never take head till then.</p>
            <p>The King to ſuppreſſe their inſolency, by the adviſe of the Biſhops, prepares an Army, which they contributed very largely to, and being bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the aſſiſtance of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, a conſiderable force is raiſed, the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> being made Generall.</p>

            <p>Notwithſtanding the declaration, the Scots are ſtil averſe, and draw up a Proteſtation of ſticking cloſe to the late Generall Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> and to their ſolemne Covenant, and perfidiouſly broke all their Articles of agreement, continue their meetings, neglect ſlighting the fortification and continue their officers in pay; which with many other inſolencies, compeld the King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of reducing them to obedience. The King fummons his Privy Councel, who conclude a Parliament to be called the 13 of <hi>April</hi> 1640, and for the preſent, each of the Councel (except <hi>Hamleton</hi> who pretended poverty) ſubſcribed large Contributions for the carrying on of the war, untill ſuch time as the Parliament ſhould convene, which was a leading card for the reſt of the Nobility, the Judges and others.</p>
            <p>The Scots being informed of the Kings Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a war, ſent the Lord <hi>Dunferling,</hi> Lord <hi>Louden,</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Douglas,</hi> and M. <hi>Markham,</hi> as Commiſſioners to repreſent the affaires of their tranſactions, which were friendly received by the King, and he well hoped that all differences might be compoſed with lenity and gentleneſſe:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170342:28"/>but it could not poſſibly be, for during the treaty moſt of the Nobility that wiſht well to the Kings intereſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> are impriſoned, procured old ſouldiers out of <hi>Holland,</hi> made divers fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, required ayd of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and by colouring their deſignes with the pretence for Religion and the cauſe of God, they had gained a very ſtrong party here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time Epiſcopacy was totally extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Presbyterian Contagion began to reigne here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a man learned, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and devout (though unſeaſonably zealous) was by the vulgar lookt upon as a great freind and favourer of Popery, by reviving ancient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Church, and ſervice of God, which gave great occaſion of diſcontent to the more preciſe and godly party.</p>
            <p>On the 13 of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1640. the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and were compoſed for the moſt part of perſons of Honour, affectionate to Religion, and their Country, onely ſome ſew violent reſtleſſe ſpirited men, that endeavoured to repreſent all the tranſactions of the King in the moſt ugly colours.</p>
            <p>The King laid before them the treacherons deſigns of the Scots, and demands 12 ſubſidies, Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> and divers other members made long ſpeeches, reciting the greivances both of Church and State, which were very many; for it is with Government both Eccleſiaſticall &amp; Civil, as it is with watches, that how good and excellent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be, length of time diſorders them, they urge that there was never more need of redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing grievances, and that would be the onely way
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170342:29"/>to procure the Subſidies required. The King promiſed to redreſſe the grievances afterward. The King ſeeing them very backward concerning the Subſidies which his preſſing neceſſities call'd for, on the ſift of <hi>May</hi> came into the Houſe, and diſſolv'd the Parliament, uſing Civill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, proteſting that <hi>he would governe as much according to Law, as if a Parliament were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſitting;</hi> yet Mr <hi>Belloſis,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> were committed for ſpeeches a ſmall time, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Crew</hi> Chaireman to the Committee for Miniſters, was committed to the Tower for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to diſcover ſome Petitions preſented to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Convocation now ſitting had formed an Oath for maintaining their Hierarchy, (as the <hi>Scots</hi> on the other ſide had Covenanted for the deſtruction of Epiſcopacy;) for which they were much blamed by many good men.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe granted a large Contribution of 45. in the pound for ſix years to be aſſeſt on all the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> toward the carrying on of the <hi>Scotch</hi> war, which was lookt upon as Illegall, being without conſent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Imitation of the <hi>Scots,</hi> began in a rude manner to aſſault the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as they did the Archbiſhop of St <hi>Andrews</hi>) conceiving him to be the onely man that adviſed the King to break up the Parliament; and on Munday the 16 of <hi>May</hi> 1640. a great number of rude diſorderd perſons meet together, and goe to his houſe at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> beſet it, but he being forewarned had ſufficiently provided for his own ſafety. Some of the principall were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and committed to the <hi>White Lyon</hi> in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170342:29"/>
               <hi>Southwarke,</hi> which not long after was violently by the multitude broke open, and the priſoners diſcharge. One of the Principall Riag-leaders was afterwards apprehended, and condemned to be hang'd drawn and quartered, to terrifie the reſt.</p>
            <p>The King being in want, applyes himſelfe to the City for ſupply, but they being diſcontented at the laſt diſſolution, pretend poverty, a likely thing, after ſo many yeares of peace, plenty, and proſperity, as they had enjoyed under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; beſides they are a little troubled at the queſtioning of their <hi>London-Dery</hi> Lands in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>They Gentry were generally more free, and afforded large Contributions, by which meanes the Army began to Muſter, the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> was appointed Generall, and the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> Lievtenant Generall; but both being indiſpoſ'd in health, the King reſolved to goe himſelfe in perſon.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1640. The Queene was delivered of a Son, who was baptized <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 20. 1640. The King advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, the Army having rendevouzed ſome dayes before; whether being come, he was informed of the ſad diſaſter of a defeate given by <hi>Leſſly</hi> to 1200 Horſe and 3000 foote, under the Command of the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> who were leſt to ſecure the paſſe over the River <hi>Tine,</hi> nere <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne;</hi> as likewiſe Sir <hi>Jacob Aſtley</hi> Governour of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> quit the Towne, after he had ſunck all the Ordinance, as being no way tenable.</p>
            <p>By this time the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and came to his command, much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170342:30"/>at my Lord <hi>Conways</hi> loſs; which <hi>Conway</hi> ſtoutly alledg'd, was neither through neglect nor overſight.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding the Covenanters had a Check in their own Country, <hi>Leſley</hi> having left ſome ſuperfluous Ordnance at <hi>Dounſe,</hi> which the Garriſon of <hi>Warwick</hi> being advertiſed of, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forth, and did ſeaze them; which allarum'd the Earle of <hi>Haddington,</hi> who with 2000 horſe and foote purſue, and with a very ſharp Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſcue them, which were carried back to <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe.</hi> The Earle being at dinner the next day with diverſe Knights and Gentlemen in a roome over the Magazine of Powder, in the midſt of their mirth they were ſuddenly blowne up, whether by eaſualty or on purpoſe, it was not known.</p>
            <p>In <hi>September</hi> following, the King was at <hi>Yorke</hi> preſented with a Petition, ſubſcribed by eleven of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility; To which he made Anſwer as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before the receipt of your Petition, his Majesty well foreſaw the danger that threatens himſelfe and Crowne, and therefore reſolveth the twenty-fourth of this moneth to ſummon all the Peeres, and with them to conſult what in this caſe is fitteſt to be done, for his own honour, and ſafety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where they with the reſt may offer any thing that may conduce to theſe ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly they were by Writs from the Lord Keeper ſummoned to attend the 24 of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great were the ſufferings at that time of the Northerne Counties; for <hi>Leſley</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall had impoſed a tax of 350 <hi>l. per diem</hi> on the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham;</hi> and 300 <hi>l.</hi> per diem on

            <p> After many meetings of the Commiſſioners, at laſt in thirteen Articles they agreed upon a ceſſation, which was ſigned by the King the 16 of <hi>October:</hi> but the Grand Treaty, was by their ſupplication to the King, appointed at <hi>London;</hi> and in the meane time all acts of Hoſtility to ceaſe.</p>
            <p>At that time the Earle of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> who had acted all along with the Covenanters, began to diſcover the treacherous Deſignes of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and now plainely ſaw that they meant nothing leſſe then what they pretended, viz. <hi>The Honour of his Majeſty, and the preſervation of Religion (as alwayes the vileſt actions, are covered with the moſt ſpecious pretences)</hi> yet was ſo wiſe as not preſently to diſcover himſelfe, but from time to time advertiz'd his Majeſty of the proceedings; which Letters by <hi>Hambiltons</hi> advice were taken out of the Kings pockets, tranſcribed and ſent to the Covenanters, who diſſembled it to the Earle, but caſt durt in his face, raiſing frivolous aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, endeavouring to make him odious to the people.</p>
            <p>Great was the Expectation of the whole Kingdome for the happy meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and every ſmall obſtruction was lookt on as a great Impediment, many Good men hoped for the redreſſe of Grievances; others waited to ſpit that venom, which they had a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1640. the Parliament began, where the King in a Gracious Speech, declared <hi>his earnest deſire for the happineſſe and proſperity of the Kingdome, giving an account of the</hi> Scotch <hi>war, and deſired them, as he promiſ'd he would, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170342:31"/>lay aſide all prejudice, and he would now clearely and freely put himſelfe upon the love and affection of his</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſubjects; deſiring them to conſider the beſt way for the ſafety and ſecurity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of</hi> England, <hi>and in order to it, for ſatisfaction of their juſt Grievances, wherein he would heartily concur, that the world might ſee his Intentions were to make this a Glorious and flouriſhing Kingdome; freely leaving it to them where to begin; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, That it ſhould not be his fault if this were not a good and happy Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Members made long Speeches about Grievances, as Sir <hi>Ben: Ruddier,</hi> Mr. <hi>Grimſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> and others, which were backt by diverſe other Members.</p>
            <p>Their firſt buſineſſe was to Vindicate diſtreſſed Miniſters, diverſe were inlarged, and reſtored to their former Livings. Many Petitions were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from moſt parts of the Kingdome for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of Grievances.</p>
            <p>The Lords complaine that the priviledges of their Houſe were broken, becauſe the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> had their Studies and Cabinets ſearched.</p>
            <p>The Houſe diſcharged Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baſtwick</hi> out of priſon; and Voted Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> 6000 <hi>l.</hi> damage: Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> 5000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi> not many dayes after, was ſent from the Commons to the Lords to Impeach the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> of High Treaſon; Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> made a report to the Houſe what Capitall Crimes were objected againſt him, upon which in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Articles he is Charg'd by Mr. <hi>Pim.</hi> The Earle is forthwith ſequeſtred the Houſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Black Rod.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:170342:32"/>
            <p> On the 18 of <hi>December,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> are Voted by the Commons Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of High Treaſon, and a Charge was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in againſt Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> upon the Reading of which he is order'd to the Tower, but upon his requeſt was reſpited for two dayes.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Windibanke</hi> principall Secretary of State fled, and not long after him my Lord <hi>Finſh,</hi> one that had been very Active for Ship-money, which was then Voted Illegal; and moſt of the Judges were Voted Delinquents.</p>
            <p>The Parliament began to ſtrike a terror into all that had any way offended, or had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in action, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> Alderman <hi>Penington</hi> with a great multitude out of <hi>London</hi> (for now it was cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for Petitioners to come in great numbers) Petitioned the Houſe againſt Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other Ceremonies of the Church, of which a Committee was appointed to conſider.</p>
            <p>The Armies in the North lay heavy upon the Kingdome, which moved the Houſe to allow 100000 <hi>l.</hi> toward their preſent pay, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be borrowed of the City of <hi>London,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſame be rayſed by ſubſidy.</p>
            <p>The King ſummons both Houſes together to the Banqueting Houſe, and <hi>declares himſelfe not ſatisfied with their ſlow proceedings, and the Great Charge of maintaining two Armyes; next of the low condition of his Navies and Forts, whereby his enemies are encouraged, and his friends diſheartned; and likewiſe tooke notice of diverſe ſtrange Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preſented to the Houſe againſt the Government of the Church; he told them, he was content with a Reformation, not an alteration of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170342:32"/>He tooke notice of a Bill preparing in the Houſe, for frequent Parliaments to be elected by the Sheriffes, without his conſent, which he could by no means admit of, it being an Inſeparable right of his Crowne; and did freely confeſſe that frequent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were the beſt means for preſerving a right underſtanding betwixt him and his ſubjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe were the two principall rocks he would have them avoyd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, arrived the Dutch Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to negotiate in behalfe of a Match, betwixt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the Kings eldeſt daughter, which the King thought fit to Impart to the Parliament, they for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doe nothing in it, but proceed to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Bill for a Trienniall Parliament, which being paſt by both Houſes, was the 16 of <hi>Feb.</hi> preſented to his Majeſty for his conſent.</p>
            <p>To whom he declares himſelf, reminding them, <hi>that this was one of the two rocks which he formerly tould them of, and that the Conſequence of it was ſuch, that never Bill paſt the Houſe of more favour to the ſubject then this; minding them that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their proceedings, he might juſtly queſtion the doing it, and took notice how they had taken the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all in pieces; how that a skilfull Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to clenſe his Watch will take it aſunder, and when it is put together, it will goe better, provided no pin be omitted. Now I have done this on my part, you know what to doe on yours, repoſing Great Truſt and confidence in your affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paſſing of this Bill, was by wiſe men thought to be none of the leaſt of his failings.</p>
            <p>Judge <hi>Barkly</hi> was by the Uſher of the black Rod arreſted, as he ſat on the Kings Bench, for high treaſon.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170342:33"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was next brought upon the ſtage, the Articles exhibited againſt him were from 14 made 28. and on the 22 of <hi>March</hi> 1640. his Triall began. The place appointed was <hi>Westminſter</hi>-Hall, where ſcaffolds were raiſed on both ſides, nine degrees in height: The two uppermoſt for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords: In the midſt in a lower aſcent ſat the Peeres of the Realme; a Throne alſo was erected for the King, but he never appear'd publiquely, but was every day of the Triall in a Cloſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery to heare and obſerve the whole proceedings, and took notes. The Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> was Lord High Steward, and the Earle of <hi>Linſey</hi> Lord High Conſtable.</p>
            <p>The Charge was principally managed by Mr. <hi>Glin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> both Members of the Commons Houſe; fifteene dayes together was the Earle arraigned, and gave in his anſwer to every particular Charge.</p>
            <p>The Commons Charge him afreſh by Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> concerning ſome Notes taken by Secretary <hi>Vane,</hi> which were diſcover'd by his ſon, of his telling the King, <hi>be had an Army in</hi> Ireland <hi>which his Majeſty might Imploy to reduce this Kingdome to obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is againe call'd to the Barre, and Mr. <hi>Glin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> endeavour to prove him Guilty by Law; They extend his Crimes, and make him as Odious as poſſible they can. The Earle moves for Councell, which the Peeres could not in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon deny: The Commons oppoſe, but after three dayes conteſt, the Peeres prevaile; Councell is aſſign'd him, <hi>viz.</hi> M. <hi>Lane,</hi> The Princes Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Mr. <hi>Gardner,</hi> Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loe,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170342:33"/>and Mr. <hi>Lightfoote;</hi> and Saturday the 17 of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill</hi> was appointed for him and his Councell to appeare, where his Councell argued his caſe in Law; that day they adjourn, not appointing any time for their next meeting.</p>
            <p>The Commons Houſe Vote him Guilty of high Treaſon, upon the evidence of Sir <hi>Henry Vanes</hi> notes, which Bill of Attainder was ſent up to the Lords, which in their Houſe was much oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after, Mr. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> The Kings Soliciter, was ſent by the Commons to the Lords, to Juſtifie the Bill by Law, which accordingly was by him performed in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall; The Earle being preſent, and The King in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed place.</p>
            <p>The Peeres in their Houſe proceed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>The King having notice of it, on the firſt of <hi>May</hi> Calls both Houſes together, <hi>where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he had been preſent at the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and that in Conſcience he could not condemne him of high Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likewiſe in Vindication of the Earle, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That he never had any Intention to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Army, nor ever was adviſed by any body ſo to doe.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That there never was any debate before him, either in publick Councell, or private Committee, of the diſloyalty of his</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſubjects.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>And that though he could not in Conſcience condemne him of high Treaſon, yet he could not cleare him of miſdemeanours; He deſired them to conſider what a tender Conſcience was, and that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170342:34"/>to ſatisfie his people, he would doe much, but in this of Conſcience, neither fear nor any other reſpect, ſhould make him goe againſt it. He deſired them to find out ſome middle way, and was of opinion that for miſdemeanours he thought him not fit to ſerve him, or the Common-wealth, in any place of truſt, no not a Conſtable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſpeech gave much diſcontent to both Houſes.</p>
            <p>Sunday, <hi>May</hi> the ſecond, The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was married to the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>White Hall,</hi> with Great ſolemnity and triumph.</p>
            <p>The next day diverſe ſeditious perſons had ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the multitude, to the number of 5000 or 6000. who in a Tumultuous manner came arm'd to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> crying out for Juſtice to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on the Earle, committed outrages on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lords, but by faire promiſes of my Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> they were appeaſed.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe poſted at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall Gate, and the <hi>Exchange,</hi> a Catalogue of thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Bill of Attainder, under the title of <hi>Strafordians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fift of <hi>May</hi> a Motion was made in the Houſe for a loan of 650000 <hi>l.</hi> to be Lent till it was Levied by Subſidy, provided the King would paſs a Bill not to adjourne, prorogue, or diſſolve this Parliament, without the conſent of both Houſes; upon which Motion a Bill was order'd to be drawne up.</p>
            <p>The Lords by advice of the Judges, Vote the Earle Guilty of the 15 and 19 Articles. And at a Conference of both Houſes, it was ordred, That ſome Lords be ſent to the King with the two Bills; one for executing the Earle, The other for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170342:34"/>continuance of this Parliament; which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was done on Saturday; and The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his anſwer on Monday.</p>
            <p>All the Sabbath day he was much perplext within himſelfe. The Clamours of the multitude, were great, he ſends for the Judges to adviſe, ſummons the Privy Councell, and with them ſpends much time in arguing the Caſe, ſends for five Biſhops, viz. <hi>London, Lincolne, Carlile, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> who for Law wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to the Judges, and for Conſcience, he having heard the whole proceedings, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him Guiltleſſe, he ought not to condemne him.</p>
            <p>The Judges in part ſatisfie the King, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he was Guilty of high Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The Earle himſelfe that day writ a Letter with his own hand, <hi>To ſet his Majeſties Conſcience at Liberty, humbly requesting him, to prevent ſuch miſchiefes as might enſue upon his refuſall, to paſs the Bill; and, That his conſent herein, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him to God more then all the world beſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Munday the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> his Majeſty being wearied with complaints, granted a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> Lord Privy Seale, Lord Chamberlain, and others, to paſs the two Bills.</p>
            <p>The next day being much afflicted in his ſpirit, he wrote to the Lords, and ſent it by the Prince, wherein he requeſts, <hi>That although he had paſt the Bill of Attainder againſt The Earle, yet deſir'd to ſhew mercy, by letting that unfortunate man to end his life in Cloſe Impriſonment; but if no leſſe then life can ſatisfie my people, I muſt ſay,</hi> Fiat Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticia. The Poſtſcript was, <hi>If he muſt die, it were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170342:35"/>Charity to reprieve him till Saturday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe returnd anſwer, that his requeſt could not poſſibly be admitted without apparent danger to Him, his Wife, and Children.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> he was brought from the Tower to the ſcaffold on Tower-hill, attended by Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> where he made his laſt Speech to the people, <hi>Proteſting his Innocency in that for which he was condemned, acquitting all the world, and deſired God to forgive them, wiſhing preſperity and happineſſe to the Kingdome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they would ſeriouſly conſider whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a Kingdome ſhould be written in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of blood; much fearing they were in the wrong way; profeſſing he died a true ſonne of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>wherein he was borne, and in which he was bred: addreſſing himſelfe to his brother Sir</hi> George Wentworth, <hi>deſired to be remembred to his Wife and Children, willing him to Charge his Son never to meddle with the patrimony of the Church, for it would prove a Canker to his eſtate; and after a ſhort time ſpent in prayer, he ſubmitted his neck to the Block, which was ſtruck off by the Executioner at one low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was at that time a diſcovery made of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe perſons that had endeavour'd the Earles eſcape out of the Tower, diverſe Gentlemen of worth were engaged in it, but the timely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very prevented its execution.</p>
            <p>Upon which the Houſe oderd ſome Lords to be aſſiſtant to the Lievtenant of the Tower for the ſafety of the City.</p>
            <p>Severall Great perſons were diſplaced, as, The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> made Lord Chamberlain, in the roome of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> The Marqueſſe of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> laſt the Parliament to engage the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſtick cloſe to them, framed an Oath or Proteſtation, which was by them taken, and ſent through <hi>England</hi> to be taken by the people.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being ſecured for their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſitting, began to conſider of the raiſing of moneys for the payment and disbanding of the two Armies; much Plate was melted downe; and the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> was by joynt conſent of King and Parliament order'd to goe downe as Generall to disband the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>The Houſe in <hi>February</hi> following, Voted 300000 <hi>l.</hi> for the <hi>Scots,</hi> and dayes of payment to be appointed.</p>
            <p>For the Levying of this money a Bill was brought into the Houſe for Pole-money, <hi>Viz.</hi> a Duke 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Marqueſſe 80 <hi>l.</hi> Earles 60 <hi>l.</hi> Vicounts and Baronets 40 <hi>l.</hi> Knights of the Bath 30 <hi>l.</hi> Knights Bachelours 20. <hi>l.</hi> Eſquires 10 <hi>l.</hi> every Gentleman able to expend 100 <hi>l per annum</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo every one according to their degree, no perſon exempted, every Head paid ſix pence; which Bill with two other were offerd to the King, one for putting downe the Star-Chamber, another for putting downe the high Commiſſion, at which the King was a little ſtartled.</p>
            <p>The Houſe Voted he ſhould ſigne all, or none, which notwithſtanding, he paſt that for Pole-money, and tooke time for the other two, and not long after with much Importunity he paſt them alſo.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170342:36"/>
            <p> Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> was ſent in the quality of an Ambaſſadour to the Emperour, to ſolicite the reſtoration of the Prince Elector, which after much ſtay and nothing effected, he returnes.</p>
            <p>The Parliament conſidering the heavy burdens of the Northern Counties, Order 100000 <hi>l.</hi> part of the 300000 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid to the <hi>Scots;</hi> and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following both Armies were quietly disbanded, and departed to their own homes.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> is committed to the Tower for miſdemeanors amounting to treaſon.</p>

            <p>The Parliament adjourned from the eight of <hi>September</hi> till the 20 of <hi>October,</hi> and appointed a ſtanding Committee of fifty Members to act in the Intervall.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being adjourn'd, and the King gone to <hi>Scotland,</hi> every one tooke advantage to vent the humour of his own braine; many uſing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170342:36"/>Irreverend behaviour during the time of divine ſervice, many outrages and riots were committed againſt Clergy-men, and the Prelaticall party (as they cald them) ſtrange and unheard-of practices were uſed, as tub-preaching, and that openly in the ſtreets; which gave occaſion to many ſober minded men to thinke evill of the Parliament, as though it was their contrivance.</p>

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:170342:37"/>Court, where they were ſumptuouſly feaſted, and diverſe Aldermen were Knighted.</p>
            <p>During the Kings reſiding at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, the Commons preſent the King a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the ſtate of the Kingdome, with a large recitall of all the Grievances and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the people had groaned under ſince the beginning of his Raigne. Upon which within few dayes the King publiſhed a Declaration in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their Remonſtrance.</p>
            <p>And now began viſibly to appeare the ſad breach betwixt the King and his Parliament, which did daily increaſe, untill the Kingdome was involved in a ſad war.</p>
            <p>Great endeavours are uſed to ſtir up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people with a diſlike of the Kings actions, to which purpoſe freedome was given to every party without contradiction, to write and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh many bitter and Invective Pamphlets againſt the Biſhops, and their Government, and all the ill actions of the Kings Miniſters were laid upon him, and not content with that, they came downe in Great multitudes to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and by the way gave uncivill and threatning Language to diverſe Gentlemen at <hi>Whitehall</hi>-Gate.</p>
            <p>Which cauſed the King to ſend to the Lord Major to ſummon a Common Councell, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his pleaſure, which by the Chancelour of the Dutchy, he declares his utter diſlike of the numerous multitude coming in that rude manner, and deſires care may be taken to prevent the like for the future, aſſuring them of his care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>And the ſame day the King ſent to the City, the Commons Petition for a Guard to defend
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170342:37"/>them from a malignant party now prevalent; which Petition the King denied, promiſing them in the word of a King, <hi>That his care for their ſecurity ſhould be as great as for his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and if that wauld not ſerve their turne, he would appoint a Guard of ſuch as he would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to God for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Proclamation was made againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, and the King deſires the two Houſes to enter into Debate concerning reliefe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that 10000 Volunteers be raiſed and ſent over, if the Commons will pay them.</p>
            <p>The King being inform'd of a deſigne carried on by diverſe Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which held Intelligence with the <hi>Scots,</hi> endeavouring to ſubvert his Authority; and the better to carry on their deſignes, countenanced the Tumults in the City, cauſes Sir <hi>William Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligrew</hi> and Sir <hi>William Fleming,</hi> to goe to the Chambers and Studies of diverſe Members of the Houſe of Commons, to ſeale up their Trunkes, and to ſeize on their papers, as the Lord <hi>Kimbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>On the third of <hi>June</hi> the King ſent his Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> to demand the five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſent a Sergeant at Armes to charge them with Articles of high treaſon, and with them

            <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1641. The King attended with diverſe Gentlemen came to the Houſe-door, he onely enter'd the Houſe of Commons, ſeating himſelfe in the Speakers Chaire, demands five
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170342:38"/>Members of that Houſe to be delivered to him; Their names were Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelrig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zill Hollis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pim,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stroud.</hi> The King finding they were not there (for they were abſent by appointment of the Houſe) riſes from the Speakers Chaire, and tells them <hi>he was very ſorry for that occaſion, and that no King ever was, nor ſhould be more carefull to preſerve the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament then he ſhould be, that thoſe five Members were dangerous men, he proteſted in the word of a King, that he never intended any force, but to proceed againſt them in a Legall way; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they would ſend them ſo ſoone as they came into the Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King is no ſooner gone out of the Houſe, but they are in a great confuſion, crying out. Priviledge, priviledge; and the next day Voted the Kings coming to the Houſe a breach of the priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King made Proclamation the next day for their apprehenſion, which the day following the Commons Voted illegall and ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>The day after he had been at the Houſe, be went in his Coach to <hi>London,</hi> being inform'd they were fled thiher, where all the way as he went, the Citizens and others flock'd about his Coach, deſiring him not to Infringe the priviledge of Parliament: Upon his returne one <hi>Walker</hi> flung into the Kings Coach a ſeditious pamphlet, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>To your Tents O Iſrael;</hi> for which he was apprehended.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen of the Inns of Court, offered their ſervice to the King as a Guard; a ſmal Court of Guard is built at <hi>White</hi>-Hall-Gate, and ſome Gentlemen entertained: Within two dayes after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170342:39"/>a great multitude came out of <hi>London</hi> in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner, to Petition againſt Biſhops, and in their paſſage by <hi>White</hi>-Hall uſing mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing tearmes, which the Gentlemen not brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome ſmall miſchiefe was done.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> they offered violence to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Biſhops, which cauſ'd 14 of them to draw up a Proteſt againſt the proceedings of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Commons reſent it ill, and Vote them Guilty of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The City Petition the King concerning the putting of perſons of Honour out of the Tower, and placing others in their roomes; and of the Great preparations in the Tower, of the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>White</hi>-Hall, and withall deſire, that the five Members may not be reſtrain'd, nor proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but by conſent of the Houſe; to all which his Majeſty gave an anſwer.</p>
            <p>Two thouſand Petitioners came out of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham-ſhire</hi> to Petition the King in the behalfe of Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> their Country-man, deſiring that he and the reſt of the five Members may injoy the Priviledges of Parliament; which moved the King to ſend to the Parliament, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he would wave his proceedings againſt the five Members.</p>
            <p>The multitude not being content with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Biſhops, they openly demand the Liturgy of the Church to be aboliſhed, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the uſe of all ſet-formes of prayer.</p>
            <p>The Pulpits every where ſounded aloud that now was the time that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and that the Juſt ſhould waſh their footſteps in the blood of the ungodly; and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170342:39"/>publickly exhorted the people, to take up armes againſt the Kings Evill Councell (as they calld it) and to deſtroy all ſuch as joyned with them: and to this effect theſe following Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were preſſed by the zealous Miniſters, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould Raigne over them, bring hither and ſlay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> Judges 5.23. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, Curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they came not to help the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi> Jer. 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed be he that keepeth back his ſword from blood.</hi> Thus there was no way for Reformation in theſe mens accounts, but to pluck up and to deſtroy, and all for the Love of God, and for the advancement of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The great multitudes ſtill reſorting to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> every day, cauſed the King for his own ſafety to repaire to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, with the Queen and Prince, for which by many good men he was much blamed.</p>
            <p>The next day after the King went to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, many Citizens, with a great company of boats, with Guns and flags, Guard the five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in Triumph, to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the King to diſlike the City.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons Petition the King for the Militia; To which he gives a ſpeedy anſwer, though not ſatisfying to them.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe Petition that the five Members may be eſtated and cleared of that Imputation of Treaſon; To which he anſwered, <hi>That he had ground and proofe enough to accuſe them, but he is willing to forbeare proſecution; if that will not doe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170342:40"/>to ſatisfie the people, he will paſs a free and Generall pardon, as they ſhall think fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King after he had been at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court ſome ſmall time, ſends for the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> then Lord Chamberlain, and the Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> Groom of the Stoole to attend him; but they refuſed, rather chooſing to obey his Writ; upon which he ſends a Meſſenger for the Staffe and Key, the Enſignes of their Office, which they willingly reſign'd.</p>
            <p>The Queen having receiv'd a Meſſage from both Houſes by the Earle of <hi>Newport</hi> and the Lord <hi>Seamor,</hi> that they intended to charge her with Treaſon.</p>
            <p>She anſwered, ſhe never ſaw any Articles in writing, and therefore gave little credit, and ſhe hop'd they would lay no aſperſions upon her that never miſtruſted the actions of one ſingle perſon, much leſſe the whole Houſe, and that ſhe ever wiſht a happy and right underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his people.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> the King and Queen went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Dover,</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> wife to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Queen went along with her into <hi>Holland;</hi> and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, carried the choiceſt Jewells of the Crown with her to pawn.</p>
            <p>During the Kings ſtay at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bill to take away Biſhops Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The King came back to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and ſends for the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to attend him in his going to <hi>York,</hi> where he intended to reſide.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Greenwich</hi> he removes to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> where he is preſented with a Petition for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170342:40"/>and likewiſe to reſide neer <hi>London,</hi> and not to take his Son with him. <hi>The King refuſed to give any other anſwer to the Militia, then what he had already done; and that he ſhould take ſuch care of his Son, as ſhould juſtifie him to God as a Father, and to his Dominions as a King, and that he conceiv'd himſelfe not ſafe neer London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe immediatly Vote, <hi>That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties anſwer was a flat deniall,</hi> and likewiſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>The Earle of Northumberland, Lord High Admirall, to take care for the providing and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Royall Navy for the ſervice of the Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe ſeeing they could not prevaile with the King for the Militia, paſt an Order for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Militia throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> in confiding perſons hands.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Huntingdon</hi> the King ſent a Meſſage to both Houſes, ſhewing the Grounds and Reaſons of his removall to <hi>York,</hi> deſiring them to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the neceſſary ſupplyes for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them by any pretence of Order or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to meddle with the Militia, or to doe or execute any thing againſt Law, he being tyed up by the Law as well as his ſubjects, and muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Upon which the Houſe drew up a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their utter diſlike of his proceedings.</p>
            <p>The King at <hi>Stamford</hi> puts forth a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for putting in execution the Laws againſt Papiſts.</p>
            <p>And being at <hi>York</hi> puts forth a Proclamation for <hi>Tunage</hi> and <hi>Poundage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eight of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1642. the King ſends a meſſage to both Houſes, declaring his Intentions to goe himſelfe in perſon to chaſtize the bloody
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170342:41"/>rebells, and that he intended to raiſe forthwith by Commiſſion a Guard for his own perſon, conſiſting of 2000 foote and 200 horſe, and to arme them from his Magazine at <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which the Houſes Petition to remove the Magazine from <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentry, Miniſters, and Freeholders of the County of <hi>York,</hi> Petition the King, to which his Majeſty gives a ſpeedy and gracious anſwer.</p>
            <p>The Houſe again Petitions, that (the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine at the Tower of <hi>London</hi> being much drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that from <hi>Hull</hi> may be brought up; to which his Majeſty anſwered, <hi>That for the Charge of Locking to the Magazine at Hull, as it was by them at first voluntarily undertaken, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, yet you may free our good people of that Charge, and leave it to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to look to, who are the proper owners of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament, though they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile by Intreaty, reſolve to doe it by poſſicy, for they had ſent to keep out the Earle of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> and committed the Towne and Fort to a faithfull Friend of theirs, Sir <hi>John Hotham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The County of <hi>York</hi> petition the King, that the Magazine may remaine there for the ſecurity of the Northern Countyes; and during the Conteſts, the Parliament went on might and maine, ſetling the Militia in many Countyes; and by Reaſon the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was indiſpoſed in health, and could not attend the Sea-ſervice, they petition that the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> may be Admirall.</p>
            <p>The King utterly refuſes the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> yet notwithſtanding the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> being Encouraged by ſome Votes of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170342:41"/>Houſe, though with ſome oppoſition, got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of moſt part of the Navy.</p>
            <p>The King attended by many of the Nobility, a great number of Gentlemen, and ſome Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, came before the walls of <hi>Hull,</hi> but found the Gates ſhut, and the Bridges drawne up by the Command of Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> a Member of the Commons Houſe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> appeared on the wall, Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, Intreating his Majeſty <hi>not to command that, which he muſt be inforc't at that time to deny, and that he could not admit him in, without breach of truſt to the Parliament, craving leave that he might have time of acquaint the Parliament.</hi> The King being very wrath, deſired to know <hi>if he had any Order in writing, expreſsly to deny his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance:</hi> And after ſome houres ſtay, Proclaimed Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> a Traytor, after he had received The Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the Prince Elector out of the Town, who had been there one day.</p>
            <p>The King forthwith ſends a Meſſage to the Parliament, accuſing <hi>Hotham</hi> for a traytor; and likewiſe ſent a Letter to the Mayor of <hi>Hull,</hi> to take care that no part of the Magazine ſhould be conveyd away without his conſent: there were Scouts appointed to Intercept all Letters between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Hull;</hi> and a Letter accordingly was Intercepted going from the Parliament to <hi>Hull,</hi> giving encouragement to Sir <hi>John</hi> to continue firme, nothing doubting but they would ſtick by him.</p>
            <p>The Houſe being Informed of the Intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Letter, Voted it <hi>a high breach of the priviledge of Parliament; and that what Sir</hi> John <hi>had done, was in obedience to that Houſe; and that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170342:42"/>the proclaiming him a traytor without due proceſs of Law, is a breach of their priviledge, against the Laws of the Land, and the liberty of the ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They likewiſe paſt an Order to prevent the Levying any Souldiers in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> or <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> to force a paſſage into the Towne of <hi>Hull;</hi> and the more to enrage the King, <hi>Hotham</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Levy The trained bands, which being come into the Towne, he diſarmes and diſmiſſes them.</p>
            <p>There was a ſelect Committee appointed to goe to <hi>Hull,</hi> with Inſtructions for the ſafety of the Counties of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> to whom all Sheriffs, Juſtices of the peace, Conſtables, and other Officers, are requir'd to be ayding and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</p>
            <p>Things began to grow very high; The King ſummons the Gentry of the County of <hi>York,</hi> where he gave them a large account of all the meſſages and replyes touching <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why he did not ſigne the Bill for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia. To be ſhort, <hi>You ſee my Magazine is going to be taken from me directly againſt my Will; The Militia againſt the Law (and my conſent) is going to be put in execution; and laſtly, Sir</hi> John Hothams <hi>Treaſon is countenanced; all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered, none can blame me to apprehend dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and upon this reall Ground to tell you, that I am reſolv'd to have a Guard onely to ſecure my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; In which I deſire you aſſiſtance, that I may be able to protect you the Laws, and the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion from any affront or Injury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſpeech was by them received with great affection.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being inform'd of the Kings
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170342:42"/>Speech to the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentry, declare <hi>that it is against the Laws and liberties of the Kingdome, that any of the ſubjects thereof ſhould be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King to attend him at his pleaſure, and that whoſoever upon pretence of his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſhall take up Armes in a warlike manner, ſhall be eſteemed diſturbers of the peace, and to be proceeded againſt accordingly:</hi> and likewiſe ſigned an Order to the Sheriffe of that County, to take care to ſuppreſſe the raiſing of the trained bands upon the Kings Command.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament Iſſue out Commiſſions to all parts of the Kingdome, appointing certain dayes for all the trained bands to be exerciſed in each County; and that ſeverall Members be ſent into the ſeverall Counties to ſee the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions put in execution, and all the Magazines in the ſeverall Counties to be put into the hands of their confiding friends.</p>
            <p>Which Commiſſions were anſwered by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the King, forbidding the trained bands and all others to riſe or muſter, on pretence of any Ordinance of Parliament, without his conſent.</p>
            <p>The breach was now growne wide; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſtill oppoſing and thwarting the King on all occaſions, moved diverſe of the Members to deſert it, and repaire to the King, ſo that in a ſmall time, the Lords at <hi>York</hi> were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The names of thoſe that went, were, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lindſey, Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Huntington, Bath, Southampton, Dorſet, Salisbury,</hi> who preſently return'd, <hi>Northampton, Devonſhire, Briſtoll, Weſtmerland, Barkſhire,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170342:43"/>Munmouth, Rivers, Newcaſtle, Dover, Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, Newport,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard, Charlton, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, Pawlet, Paget, Matreverſe, Willowby, Rich, Fawconbridge, Chandois, Coventry, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, Savill, Seymor, Mohune, Dunſmore,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell, Gray</hi> of <hi>Ruthen;</hi> Together with above fifty of the Commons Houſe, whoſe departure ſtartled the active men of the Houſe, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding having gone ſo far, proceed and Vote, <hi>That it appeares that the King being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by evill Councell, Intends to make war againſt the Parliament, and that when he doth, it is a breach of truſt repoſed in him; and likewiſe that whoſoever ſhall ayd or aſſist him in the ſaid war, are traytors by the fundamental Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the 30 of <hi>May</hi> by Vote ſummon nine of thoſe Lords that went, to returne, but they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed, which the Houſe deemed a ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, which occaſioned Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> after a long Speech to Impeach them of high treaſon, which the Peeres afterwards confirm'd, in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them <hi>never to ſit in the Houſe more, and to be uncapable of any priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not long after the Lord Keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> ſent away the Great Seale to the King, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed it, which put the Houſe to a great plunge for the preſent.</p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1642. The two Houſes ſent a Petition with 19 Propoſitions to the King, to which he reutrn'd a ſmart anſwer, taxing them, <hi>that they had contrary to law preſſed their Ordinances on the people, wreſted from him the command of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, countenanced the Treaſon of</hi> Hotham, <hi>and had directed to the people Invectives against his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170342:43"/>aſperſt him with the favouring of Papiſts; and with an utter diſlike of the Propoſitions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that if he were vanquiſht and a priſoner, in worſe condition then any the most unfortunate of his predeceſſors had ever been reduced unto, he would never ſtoop ſo low as to Grant thoſe demands, and to make himſelfe of a King of</hi> England, <hi>a Duke of</hi> Venice.</p>
            <p>And now both ſides prepare for war: The Parliament the 10 of <hi>June</hi> 1642. paſt an Order for bringing in money and plate to maintaine horſe and foote for defence of the publick peace, for which they did engage the publick faith.</p>
            <p>The King on the other ſide receives advice by Letters from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> of a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Armes and Ammunition, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided upon ſome Jewells pawned by the Queen; he likewiſe ſends Commiſſions of <hi>Array,</hi> with Letters to the Lieutenants of the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, making uſe of the Parliaments Vote, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>That the Kingdome being in danger of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies abroad, and a Popiſh party at home, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put the people in a poſture of defence, that you immediately cauſe to be reſtored all the ancient trained bands, and free-hold bands, and to appoint Collonells and Captaiens, and other Officers, to command them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament Vote the Commiſſion to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, and the actors therein, to be eſteemed diſturbers of the peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the King ſummons the Lords of the Councell, with the reſt of the Nobility at <hi>York,</hi> and declares <hi>that he requires no obedience of them, but what ſhall be according to law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to yeeld to no commands Illegally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170342:44"/>by any other, and that he will not Ingage them in any war againſt the Parliament, except for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary defence againſt ſuch as ſhall Invade him or them;</hi> Upon which, with unanimous conſent, they all freely engag'd to him their duty and allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>The King ſends a Letter to the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> Aldermen and Sheriffes, forbidding any contribution of money and plate toward the raiſing of any Armies whatſoever for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>By this time the Armes were arrived from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the King wanted men to weild them, yet by his Speeches and Declarations, had gained the affections of many of his people, and a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number was got together; and from <hi>Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he ſends a Meſſage and Proclamation to the Parliament, of his Intentions to goe againſt <hi>Hull,</hi> requiring it might be delivered up to him, which they anſwer'd with a Petition, moving him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with his two Houſes; they likewiſe ſet out a Declaration for the ſafety of <hi>Hull,</hi> promiſing ſatisfaction for all damages ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>On the 11 of <hi>June</hi> 1642. The Parliament Vote that an Army ſhall be raiſed for the defence of King and Parliament, and the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to be Generall.</p>
            <p>The King according to his former Intentions, with an Army of 3000 foote and 1000 horſe, Intends to beſiege <hi>Hull</hi> by Land, and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that none on paine of death carry any proviſions into <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hotham</hi> being Inform'd of the Kings advance, ſummons a Councell of War, which reſolve to hold the King play with their Ordinance, till the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170342:44"/>tide came in, and then to draw up their ſluces, which accordingly was performed with much damage to the Kings Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hotham</hi> likewiſe ſends to the Parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring 500 men for the ſafety of the Towne, and proviſions.</p>
            <p>Upon which by command of the Parliament, Drums are beaten p in <hi>London,</hi> and other adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Counties, for Volunteers to goe immediatly to <hi>Hull,</hi> and within a week 500 men and more were ſent by Sea under the command of Sir <hi>John Meldram,</hi> to aſſiſt Sir <hi>John Hotham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King calls a Councell, and reſolves to break up the ſiege.</p>
            <p>By this time the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> was poſſeſt of moſt of the Fleete for the ſervice of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and they were in a conſiderable way to raiſe an Army, by the aſſiſtance of that maſs of money and plate that was brought in, for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Incredible with what zeale and affection (by the Miniſters perſwaſions) the people were willing to be rid of their Treaſure, every one vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who ſhould contribute moſt; nay the women and maidens ſpared not their Rings, Thimbles and Bodkins, for the advancement of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> with much prudence raiſeth a conſiderable body of horſe and foote. The Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> was Voted to be Generall of the Horſe.</p>
            <p>Collonell <hi>Goring,</hi> eldeſt Son to the Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> was ſent down to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ſuddenly he declares for the King.</p>
            <p>The King being return'd to <hi>York,</hi> ſummons the Gentry, and requires their aſſiſtance for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Regiment for the Princes Guard, to be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170342:45"/>commanded by the Earle of <hi>Cumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament declare againſt the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Array,</hi> &amp; Vote it Illegall: on the other ſide, the King being Inform'd of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his raiſing an Army, proclaimes hm a Rebell and a Traytor to the King and his Crowne, and that all Collonells and other Officers under his Command, that ſhall not Inſtantly lay downe their Armes, are Guilty of High Treaſon. And likewiſe Commands the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hartford,</hi> to raiſe what Forces he could to ſuppreſſe him.</p>
            <p>Great was the Conteſt almoſt in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, betwixt the Parliament Commiſſioners, and the Commiſſioners of <hi>Array.</hi> In ſome Counties the Kings party prevailed, in others the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>London</hi> the Great Metropolis was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted; for Sir <hi>Richard Gurney,</hi> then Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor was committed to the Tower, for cauſing the Kings Commiſſion of <hi>Array</hi> to be read, and was by the Lords deprived of his Majoralty, never to beare Office in City or Common-wealth, and to continue priſoner during the pleaſure of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The King being at <hi>York</hi> publiſheth a Grand Declaration of all the proceedings from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Parliament to this preſent time, concluding with a ſolemn Proteſtation of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to Parliaments, and the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdome; and within few dayes ſends a Meſſage to the Parliament, taxing them with borrowing 100000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Adventures mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the reliefe of <hi>Ireland;</hi> to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne a ſpeedy anſwer.</p>
            <p>The King in perſon moveth from place to place; On the 22 of <hi>July</hi> he made a Speech to the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170342:45"/>Gentry in <hi>Leiceſterſhire;</hi> on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the Gentry in <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> and that war might not want its ſolemnity, on the 20 of <hi>August,</hi> he ſets up his Standard Royall at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and by Proclamation requires the ayd and aſſiſtance of all his Subjects on the North ſide <hi>Trent,</hi> and within twenty miles Southward thereof, for his juſt defence; and that whoſoever ſhall ſupply him with money and plate, he (as God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him) will repay and reward, accordin gto the meaſure of their love and affection to him and their Country.</p>
            <p>On the 25 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1642. from <hi>Nottingham</hi> the King ſends a Meſſage to both Houſes, by the Earles of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Culpepper,</hi> for a treaty of peace; and <hi>that an equall number may be choſen to meet where they ſhould appoint, that there may, if poſſible, be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, out of a deep ſenſe of the Calamities that attend the Kingdome.</hi> To which they anſwer, <hi>That untill he recalls that Proclamation which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes them Rebells, and takes down his Standard, they will by no meanes heare of it:</hi> To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, <hi>That to remove all ſcruples that may hinder the Treaty, by him ſo much deſired, ſo that a day be appointed by the Parliament for revoking their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations againſt all perſons as traytors aſſiſting him, he will with all chearfulneſs on the ſame day recall his Proclamations, and take down his Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; and likewiſe promiſed to grant any thing that ſhould be for the good of his ſubjects, aſſuring them that his greateſt deſire was to get a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which they humbly anſwer and petition, <hi>that his Majesty would take down his Standard,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170342:46"/>withdraw his Declarations, and leave his Forces, and returne to the Parliament, and receive their faithfull advice, of whoſe reall affection he need not to doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within few dayes the King ſends a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>That he could neither doe nor offer any more then he had already, and that he ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe cleare fromany blood that might be ſpilt in this quarrell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament give encouragement to the well affected, that what moneys they ſhould lend, ſhould be ſatisfied out of Delinquents eſtates; and declare, that whoſoever ſhall returne from the King to the Parliament within ten dayes ſhall be pardoned, excepting the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Newcaſtle, Cumberland, Briſtoll, Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Hide, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimion Porter,</hi> Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Vicount <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> Vicount <hi>Haltland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament being Inform'd that the Queen was ſoliciting the States of <hi>Holland</hi> to contribute Armes and Ammunition for the King, ſend Mr. <hi>Walter Strickland,</hi> a Member of the Houſe, over into <hi>Holland,</hi> with Credentiall Letters. They likewiſe drew up a Declaration to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> to ſatisfie them of their whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in <hi>September</hi> arrive in <hi>England,</hi> and offer their ſervice to their Uncle, who were immediatly put into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with a ſmall body of Horſe flew up and downe through diverſe Counties, and gained a conſiderable body together.</p>
            <p>The King himſelf moves, though with a ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170342:46"/>pace, and had gotten a great number together, marches to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (a place of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as being the Inlet to <hi>Wales</hi>) where he orders a Mint to melt down the plate, which was largely contributed by the Gentry, and offers the Crowne Lands in Morgage to eaſe the Country of the burthen of taxes and free Quarter.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> is choſen Generall for the King, and the Generall Rendevouz of his Forces was appointed at <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Generall for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appointed a Rendevouz of all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Forces at <hi>Northampton,</hi> being about 20000 Horſe and foote, who gave ſtirct Charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine all prophaneſs and diſorders in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>He divided his Army into ſeverall bodyes, to prevent the Roving of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and to find out the King: from <hi>Northampton</hi> he marches to <hi>Coventry,</hi> thence to <hi>Warwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worceſter</hi> was poſſeſt by Sir <hi>John Byron:</hi> a skirmiſh happened betwixt Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fines,</hi> Collonell <hi>Sands,</hi> Captain <hi>Hales,</hi> and others. Thus, the Prince came out of <hi>Worceſter</hi> into a greene Meadow, reſolv'd to fight thoſe he could firſt meete withall; The paſſage to the Meadow was narrow; Collonell <hi>Sands</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-valiant Charg'd with his Regiment before the reſt could come up; both ſides being equall in number, fought with Great reſolution, but the prince fearing the Generalls approach, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>Worceſter,</hi> though with ſome loſs in the Reare, being purſued through the Towne by the Parliaments Forces: Collonell <hi>Sands,</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant Major <hi>Duglaas</hi> were ſlaine at the firſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170342:47"/>Charge. There was found dead in all thirteen perſon.</p>
            <p>The Prince marcht immediately to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and the King with ſome horſe marcheth into <hi>Wales,</hi> and made a Speech full of proteſtations to the Gentry of <hi>Denbighſhire</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> and returnes to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where his ſtrength much increaſed, being 16000 foote, and 5000 Horſe and Dragoones.</p>
            <p>Both Armies think of providing winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Collonell <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with two Regiments of foote, is appointed Governour of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but not long after was order'd to <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> The towne being divided, and hearing of his coming, began to mutiny, but he had a party which opened the gates to him in the night, and ſurpriz'd the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiners.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Eſſex</hi> Removall from <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Maſſey</hi> was appointed Governour.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſends horſe and ſoote to the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> to make a body, to prevent the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> going to <hi>Wollverhampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> ſummons the County to bring horſe and carts for his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, who marches neer <hi>Coventry,</hi> and that night lay at <hi>Southam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King ſo exceedingly increaſed in ſtrength, that he cauſed feare in thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the trained bands of <hi>London,</hi> and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Counties, to be in readineſs, and to ſet up Poſts and Chaines in all the paſſages into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and order twelve Companies out of <hi>London</hi> for the ſecurity of <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The Parliament Vote that it was and ſhould be lawfull for all Counties in <hi>England</hi> to enter into
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170342:47"/>a mutuall aſſociation, for the defence each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The danger that the Parliament apprehended was reall, for the King had gotten between the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and they conjectur'd it more feſable forhim to attempt <hi>London,</hi> then fight the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> at that time abounded with <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> commanded by the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Wortley,</hi> Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Cornwall</hi> there was a conſiderable ſtrength for the King, who were commanded by Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Wales</hi> they began to body, beſides the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the King Commanded, and a great body of horſe commanded by Prince <hi>Rupert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King with an Army of 14000 foote and 4000 Horſe and Dragoones came on Saturday the 22 of <hi>October</hi> within ſix miles of <hi>Keynton,</hi> and quarter'd his Army at <hi>Crepeda</hi> and <hi>Edghill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> quarter'd at <hi>Keinton</hi> with his Army.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 28. both Armies draw up in a body. The King having the advantage of a high hill, called <hi>Edg Hill,</hi> at the foote of which was a vale, call'd the <hi>Vale of the red horſe,</hi> where <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army was drawne up upon a Riſing Ground, in Battalia, three Regiments of horſe on the right wing, commanded by Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Belford,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fielding,</hi> Sir <hi>John Meldram</hi> commanded the Van; the Generall, Collonell <hi>Hollis,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> in the Reare; on the left wing twenty Troops of Horſe commanded by Sir <hi>James Ramſey.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:170342:48"/>
            <p> The Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> was Generall for the King, but the Battaile was order'd by the Lord <hi>Ruthen</hi> Earle of <hi>Forth.</hi> The Generall on foote led on the maine body of the Army with a pike in his hand.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhewed perſonall Valour, till he was diſſwaded not to expoſe himſelfe to danger, and ſo retir'd to the body.</p>
            <p>The Forlorn on the Kings ſide was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Major <hi>Backſtake</hi> and Captain <hi>Hamond,</hi> who being come downe to the bottom of the hill, charg'd the Parliaments Forlorn, which was no ſooner done, but the Kings Canons began to play.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> Generall of the Horſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Right wing, Charg'd furiouſly the Left wing of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army, and Routed them, purſuing them to <hi>Keinton</hi> Towne, tooke the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, the Earles Waggons, and Cloak-bag, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too Eager of the plunder.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> being too adventurous was kil'd, and by reaſon of the abſence of Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> the maine body of the Kings was aſſaulted with great fury, and his Standard taken (Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Varney</hi> the Standard-bearer being kil'd) which was afterwards retaken, by an unknown perſon, and convey'd away.</p>
            <p>The foote on both ſides Charge with equall Valour, untill the night came on, which parted the fight.</p>
            <p>Both Armies continue in the field all night, and the next day the King made Proclamation of pardon to ſuch as would lay down their armes and ſubmit. The Victory was much diſputed, both ſides returning thanks to God for Victory.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170342:48"/>Indeed there was reall ſignes of Victory on both ſides, by the taking of Colours and Canons of equall number. And although the Parliament loſt more men, yet the King loſt more men of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The number of the ſlaine was computed to be between five and ſix thouſand.</p>
            <p>The Kings Army drew off toward <hi>Keinton,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> withdrew toward <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Examining the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Cabinet, they diſcover'd one <hi>Blake</hi> that attended the King to be Treacherous, by holding a Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who was immediatly condemn'd by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of War, and hang'd in the high way.</p>
            <p>On the Parliaments ſide were ſlain of note, the Lord S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> Collonell <hi>Ch. Eſſex,</hi> Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Ramſey.</hi>

            <p> At that time the Parliaments Army was much viſited with the Contagion, many dying daily.</p>
            <p>On the fift of <hi>July</hi> was a great defeat given to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in the Weſt (after he had continued there victoriouſly for ſome time) by a party from <hi>Oxford,</hi> conducted by the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> which defeate gave a great Check to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Generall by reaſon of the ſickneſſe, and other great wants of his Army, marches towards <hi>London,</hi> quartering them at <hi>Kingston</hi> on <hi>Thames,</hi> and other adjacent places.</p>
            <p>Great were the ſucceſſes of the King almoſt in every part of the Kingdome; for Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was quite routed in the Weſt, Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> in the head of a Gallant Army, upon whom the King was pleaſed for his fidelity and Valour, to confer the Honour and Title of a Baron.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was order'd to beſiege <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> which in ſhort time was deliver'd to him.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> beſieged <hi>Exceter</hi> (whither the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> was fled) which on the fourth of <hi>September</hi> 1643 was diliver'd up to him upon Articles, Sir <hi>John Barkly</hi> was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and moſt of the Parliaments forces in the North were defeated &amp; driven into <hi>Hull,</hi> by the Lord of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> who at that time commanded the Greateſt Army in <hi>England,</hi> and not onely able to terrifie the Parliaments Forces in <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe formidable to any <hi>Scotch</hi> forces that ſhould come to their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Collonell <hi>Goring</hi> landed at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> with 200 old Souldiers.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170342:52"/>
            <p> The Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in his march from <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> ſurprized <hi>Leeds,</hi> and in it diverſe perſons of quality, friends to the Parliament; he likewiſe proclaimes the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> traytor.</p>
            <p>The King in the Head of a Gallant Army ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> offering free pardon and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Inhabitants, if they would lay downe their Armes, requiring a poſitive anſwer in two houres. In the Interim he ſurrounds the Towne with ſix thouſand Horſe and foote; by the time appointed, the Magiſtrates, Officers, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, returne this anſwer; <hi>That they kept the Towne for his Majeſty and his Royall poſterity, and doe accordingly conceive our ſelves wholly bound to obey the Commands of his Majeſty ſignified by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, and are reſolved by Gods Help to keep the City accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King ſtood amazed at their confidence, for at that time they could not hope for reliefe; In the Towne was onely one Regiment of foote, an hundred Horſe, beſide the trained bands, in all not exceeding fifteen hundred men. The King reſolves to lay a cloſe ſiege, and a conſiderable party Intrencht on the South and Eaſt ſide, though they within ſallied out with ſome damage to the Kings forces, the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> forces on the North weſt ſide, Generall <hi>Ruthen</hi> on the South-ſide, the Eaſt and South parts were dam'd up with Earth: They within make no leſſe then eight ſallies in ten dayes, with no ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the beſiegers.</p>
            <p>The King prepares for a ſtorme, which with much valour was performed on both ſides; a mine was ſprung under the Eaſt gate, which they countermand by the induſtry of Collonell <hi>Maſſey</hi> the Governour.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170342:52"/>
            <p> The Parliament being inform'd of the Kings Intentions toward <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> order the Generall to march out, who muſtred about 10000 Horſe and foote at <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> and ſo marches forward for the reliefe of the Towne. They likewiſe took care for recruiting an Army for Sir <hi>William Waller.</hi> The Generall being come within ſeven miles of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> fired ſome pieces of Ordinance to give notice of his approach. On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> a party of Horſe is ſent to face him, whilſt the King drew off from the ſiege.</p>
            <p>Many of the Kings friends much blamed him for ſitting downe before the Towne, when he might without difficulty have come to <hi>London,</hi> and fully ended the work; for the Parliament were never in ſo low a condition ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the warre, as they were when the King firſt ſat downe before the Towne.</p>
            <p>The Lords Houſe being ſenſible of the danger, Uote a Treaty, and the Commons were conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>The Parliament ſent to require the aſſiſtance of their brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Vote 30000 <hi>l.</hi> be inſtantly borrowed for their advance.</p>
            <p>The Solemne League and Covenant was drawn up, and taken by all the Members of both Houſes, and orderd to be Impoſed on all the aſſociated Counties; Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> a reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine, was Impriſoned for refuſing to take it.</p>
            <p>The King immediately ſends out his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it, in theſe words; <hi>Whereas there is printed a paper pretended to be order'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament, on the</hi> 21 <hi>of</hi> September <hi>laſt, to be printed and publiſhed, which Covenant, though
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170342:53"/>it ſeemes to make ſpecious expreſſions of piety and religion, it is indeed nothing elſe but a traiterous and ſeditious combination againſt him, and againſt the eſtabliſhed religion and Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in purſuance of a traiterous deſigne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring in forraine forces to invade this Kingdome: his Majeſty doth therefore ſtraitly charge and command all his loving ſubjects, of what degree and quality ſoever, upon their allegiance, that they preſume not to take the ſaid ſeditious and traiterous Covenant; moſt ſtraitly forbidding all his ſubjects to tender the ſaid Covenant, as they will anſwer the contrary at their extreameſt perill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> came to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to tender their allegiance to the King, but after a ſhort ſtay return'd to the Parliament.</p>

            <p>On Wedneſday the 20 of <hi>September</hi> 1643. was fought the famous battell of <hi>Newbery,</hi> on which depended the condition of the whole Kingdome.

            <p>The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> having ſat from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> to <hi>Aprill,</hi> and done no great matter, the King after a Speech prorogues them to the 8 of

            <p>The Counteſſe of <hi>Darby</hi> held out <hi>Latham Houſe</hi> againſt a conſiderable force of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for neer 18 weeks; The beſiegers hearing of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> advance for the Counteſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, drew off from the ſiege, upon which they ſally out and did great Execution upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>The Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Vote it treaſon for any Member of either Houſe to deſert them,

            <p>The King preſently marches to <hi>Bath,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to follow the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was gone that way.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Kings Souldiers were very deſirous to fight, but it was thought more convenient to keep them up from proviſions.</p>
            <p>In eight dayes attendance very little was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but ſome ſmall skirmiſhes of Horſe; a party of 1500 foote was ſent Weſt to prevent all proviſions coming that way.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170342:55"/>moſt of their great Pieces behind them, the King followed, and fell in upon the reare, forc't them to retire in diſorder, and had not night preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in all probability, the whole Army had been deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The next morning Early the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> quit his command, and went by boate to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> They require a Parly, and choſe Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Barkley,</hi> Collonell <hi>Whichcot,</hi> and Collonell <hi>Butler</hi> on the Parliaments party; On the Kings ſide, Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> the Lord Generall, and the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> in eight Articles the agreement was made, to deliver up all their Artillery, with all their bag and baggage, no perſon under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Corporall to weare any kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, all Officers above onely ſword and piſtoll; There were accordingly deliver'd up 49 Pieces of Braſſe Ordinance, 200 barrells of powder, with bullet and match proportionable, 9000 Armes for Horſe and foote, ſome thouſands of the common Souldiers were immediately upon their deſire entertain'd in his Majeſties ſervice.</p>

            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this Great Victory, the King ſends a Meſſage to both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a peace, and likewiſe a Letter to the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

            <p> The Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> met againe, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately they fell into diviſions and factions, which the King plainly perceived could produce no good effect, in <hi>March</hi> following he diſſolves them.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>Estates</hi> of the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> ſend over Ambaſſadours to mediate in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of a peace betwixt the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> goes on Victoriouſly with a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army, relieves <hi>Bolton, Stopford,</hi> and <hi>Lever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole,</hi> advances to <hi>York</hi> (in his way Raiſes the ſiege of <hi>Latham Houſe</hi>) which was at that time beſieged by the Parliaments Forces. Upon his approach the Enemy drew off their ſiege. They within ſally out and doe ſome miſchiefe to the reare of the Enemy. The Prince purſues them, with a Reſolution to give them Battaile.</p>
            <p>At laſt he comes to <hi>York,</hi> upon whoſe approach the beſiegers drew off; the Prince follows, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to fight them, and accordingly the third of <hi>July</hi> 1644 at ſeven a clock in the morning the fight began, the Parliaments Forces having the advantage of the ground, being on the South ſide of <hi>Marſton Moore,</hi> within four miles of <hi>York;</hi> the Prince with the Right wing fell on the Parliaments Forces, routs them; the Generall <hi>Goring,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> fell on the maine body of the Enemy, and routed them, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them too far, the Enemy Rallied, and fell on the divided bodyes, totally diſperſt them, took 3000 priſoners, 20 pieces of Ordinance, beſide a conſiderable quantity of Officers.</p>

            <p>The Kings Forces lay ſiege to <hi>Melcomb Regis. Crumwell</hi> intends to joyne with <hi>Waller</hi> for its reliefe.</p>

            <p>And on the 17 of <hi>June</hi> they began to ſtorme; the Governour perceiving the danger, ſends a Trumpet to deſire a parly for the delivery of the Towne; which was concluded in then Articles, and the next day the Towne was delivered up.

            <p>Sir <hi>William Brereton</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> ſell on a party of the Kings, routed them, and took 300 priſoners.</p>
            <p>Not long after Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Carlile</hi> for the King, having been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time beſieg'd, and having no hopes of Reliefe, delivers up the Towne on honourable Conditions.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> marches with the beſt part of the Army to the Reliefe of <hi>Taunton,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Goring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that time there was in the Weſt a multitude of Rude people called Clubmen, who declaring for the King, did great miſchiefe to diverſe of the Parliaments Garriſons; they boldly Capitulate with Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſafe paſſage for ſuch as they ſhould appoint to goe both to the King and Parliament, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> civilly ſends them an anſwer, which not anſwering their expectation, and fearing to oppoſe ſo potent an Army, they draw off in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, not without doing ſome miſchiefe to the Governour of <hi>Linne</hi> then for the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon the news of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall within a dayes march of <hi>Taunton, Goring</hi> draws off his forces, the beſieged ſally out, and

            <p>They ſtill purſuing, at laſt engaged <hi>Goring</hi> at <hi>Langport,</hi> whom they worſted and put to flight, having taken diverſe Colours, ſome Armes and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Generall returnes with the Army, and reſolves to beſiege <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> and having ſtaid ſome time till ſupplyes came, he cloſely begirts the Towne, ſummons the Governour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes a reſolute anſwer, being every way well fortified and provided. The Generall reſolves to ſtorme it on Munday the 22 of <hi>July</hi> 1645. Which accordingly was performed with much Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the enemy within being nothing daunted, fling Granadoes and other combuſtible ſtuffe, to the prejudice of the beſiegers.</p>
            <p>The Generall the next day ſends a Meſſage, telling them that their deniall had wrought in him no thoughts of Compaſſion, but onely to women and children, who might otherwiſe ſuffer by the Governours obſtinacy, and accordingly diverſe Ladyes and Gentlewomen and Children came out of the Towne.</p>
            <p>The Generall aſſaults them againe, and at laſt compells them to a ſurrender; they all to ſubmit themſelves priſoners, and the Towne to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from plunder, which accordingly was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Immediately after <hi>Pomfret</hi> and <hi>Scarborough</hi> Caſtles were ſurrendred; no Reliefe being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>Toward the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> the Generall ſummon'd <hi>Bath,</hi> which was accordingly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</p>

            <p> In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1645. Lieutenant Generall <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> falls on the Club-men, who at that time were very high and inſolent, kills diverſe, and took above 300 priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Generall ſummons <hi>Sherburne</hi> Caſtle, of which Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> was Governour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd a reſolute anſwer; but the next day was taken by ſtorme.</p>
            <p>The Generall immediately reſolves to beſiege <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> which was govern'd by Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> Orders were ſent for Ships to begirt it by Sea, he ſummons the Governour, who refuſing to ſurrender, immediately he ſurrounds it; they within ſally out ſix or ſeven times, not without loſſe on both ſides: at laſt it was agreed, to ſend a poſitive ſummons, and upon refuſall to ſtorme it.</p>
            <p>The Prince requires leave to know the Kings minde, but the Generall would by no meanes permit it.</p>
            <p>Upon the Princes refuſall, at a Councell of War it was reſolv'd to ſtorme it, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was with much Courage performed; the Towne was fired in many places, which moved the Prince to requeſt a parly, which the Generall conſented too, on condition that care ſhould be taken to quench the fire, and accordingly by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of agreement the 11 of <hi>September</hi> 1645.

            <p>All this while the King moves up and downe, ſometimes in <hi>Wales,</hi> ſometimes in one County, ſometimes in another, ſtill hearing the miſhaps and diſaſters hapning on the neck one of another; ſo that all his hopes were almoſt fruſtrate.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi> with part of the Army marches Weſtward, who after he had ſoundly batterd the Caſtle at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> forc't it to be ſurrendred; and not many dayes after he comes before <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſummons it, which was on honourable Conditions ſurrenderd.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> being encouraged by the Votes of the Houſe, pretend, <hi>that</hi> Scotland <hi>was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the late war, and that his Majeſties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in</hi> Scotland, <hi>might endanger the peace of that Nation;</hi> ſo that it may truly be ſaid of him, as the Scripture expreſſeth of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt it was concluded, 100000 <hi>l.</hi> to be told at <hi>York,</hi> ſealed and put in boxes; The <hi>Scots</hi> to give Hoſtages to deliver up <hi>Newcaſtle, Tinmouth,</hi> and all other Garriſons, thereabout; the other 100000 <hi>l</hi> when they ſhall goe on the other ſide of <hi>Tine;</hi> The other 200000 <hi>l.</hi> to be ſecured to be paid out of Delinquents eſtates; They to deliver up the King, and depart home, and quit all their Garriſons.</p>
            <p>The Aſſemblyes Confeſſion of Faith, was Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Houſe to be printed.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe an Ordinance paſt for continuing the Army under Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> for ſix moneths, and the disbanding Major Generall <hi>Maſſeys</hi> Brigade.</p>
            <p>The Common Enemy being quite beaten out of the field, there hapned ſad diviſions in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Army at home; They were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into two ſeverall parties, under the title of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent,</hi> the <hi>Independent</hi> being the moſt ſubtill and cloſe, Inſinuated into

                  <p>His Majeſties thoughts have been alwayes ſincerely bent to the peace of his Kingdomes, was and will be ever deſirous to take all wayes that might moſt clearely make appeare the candor of his Intentions to his people, and to this end could find no better way then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a perſonall and free debate with his two Houſes of Parliament, upon all the preſent differences: yet finding very much contrary to his expectation, that this offer was laid aſide, His Majeſty beat all his thoughts to make his Intentions fully knowne by a particular anſwer to the Propoſitions deliver'd to him in the name of both Kingdomes the <hi>24</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt; and that his Majeſty plainly ſaw, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever anſwer he could give, was ſubject to miſ-informations and miſ-conſtructions, which upon his own explanation he is confident will give good ſatisfaction for the ſetling of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace; to which purpoſe his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to come to <hi>London,</hi> or any of his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereabouts, upon the publick faith and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity

                  <p>To conclude, it is your King that deſires to be heard, (the which if refuſed to a ſubject by a King, he would be thought a tyrant for it) wherefore his Majeſty requeſts you to accept this offer, and that it will be the readieſt way to make theſe Kingdomes a Comfort to their Friends, and a Terror to their Enemies.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 28 his Majeſty was pleaſed to beſtow a viſit on the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> who was at that time dangerouſly ſick.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty made a Reſolution to keep every fryday a day of ſolemne faſting and humiliation.</p>
            <p>The Commons Vote and Order what Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be ſlighted, and which continued.</p>
            <p>The Parliament Vote likewiſe the remainder of the Army to disband, all but thoſe that were appointed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſeverall Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Upon which diverſe Petitions came in from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Counties to the Generall, not to disband till ſuch time as he had fully ſettled the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; whereupon immediately the Army had a Randevouz, and draw up a Petition to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Parliament, <hi>That their arreares might be payd; An act of Indempnity paſſe, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them; that the foote might not be compeld to ſerve out of the Kingdome; that the widdowes and children of ſuch as had loſt their lives in the ſervice might be provided for;</hi> which Petition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Colonell <hi>Hamond,</hi> Colonell <hi>Rich,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Ireton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament ſhewed their diſlike of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and Vote that thoſe that ſhall continue in this diſturbing condition, ſhall be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as enemies to the State.</p>
            <p>Petitions were likewiſe on the other ſide out
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170342:68"/>of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and other Counties, preſented to the Parliament, of their utter diſlike of the Armyes proceedings. But to cloſe the breach, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners are choſen by the Parliament and Army, and meete in order to a Right underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The Parliament order 60000 <hi>l.</hi> a moneth for payment of the Forces appointed, to prevent free quarter.</p>
            <p>Upon his Majeſties deſire to come neere <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Lords Vote him to come to <hi>Otelands,</hi> ſo ſoone as the Houſe can be provided; to which the Commiſſioners conſent.</p>
            <p>After his Majeſty had been neere five moneths at <hi>Holmbey,</hi> on the fourth of <hi>June</hi> 1646. neare a thouſand Souldiers, Commanded by Cornet <hi>Joyce,</hi> came ſomewhat late to <hi>Holmbey,</hi> and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeake with his Majeſty; it was anſwered that then it was unſeaſonable; However, with much Importunity Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſties preſence, where he tould him he was come by command of the Army to remove him from that place; his Majeſty replyed, it was then too late, but in the morning he would ſpeak further with him.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty according to his promiſe came downe in the morning to the Cornet, where he was attended by the Souldiers; he askt them by what Authority they came there; they replyed from the Army; He further askt if they came from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his Army; the Cornet replyed from the Army.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty ſaid, what if I ſhould refuſe to goe with you, would you compell me; they replyed, we hope your Majeſty will not refuſe, but we have command to bring you.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170342:68"/>
            <p> His Majeſty replyed, I have theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to put to you, which if you conſent to, I will goe with you.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, <hi>That he might have no violence offer'd to his perſon;</hi> they all unanimouſly ſhouted and cryed out, none, none.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He deſired <hi>that his trunks and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers might not be rifled and tumbled;</hi> they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet a Guard on them, and that they ſhould not be toucht.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He requir'd ſuch ſervants to attend him, against whom there was no juſt acceptions;</hi> they anſwered he ſhould.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He deſired <hi>that nothing be Impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him contrary to his Conſcience;</hi> they anſwered, it was not their Judgement to force-any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience on any one, much leſſe on his Majeſty; At one of the Clock his Majeſty went along with them.</p>
            <p>The next day the Generall ſent a Letter to the Parliament, to certifie that he knew nothing of the party that attended his Majeſty, neither what number, nor by what Authority: the reaſon that the party had ſent to him, he ſends up, which was that there were certaine perſons that intended to take away his Majeſty, thereby to make a new warre, the plot and plotters they were able to prove, when call'd thereunto, which neceſſitated them to ſecure his Majeſties perſon.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty was according to his own deſire, convey'd to <hi>Newmarket;</hi> by this we ſee clearely, that the Greateſt in the world, are but pilgrims on Earth.</p>
            <p>The Generall and Army Randevouz at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Houſe being Informed of the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and the Chaplains attendants on his Majeſty, Order a Letter to be forthwith ſent to the Governour for their removall.</p>

            <p>From <hi>Hatfield</hi> his Majeſty was removed to <hi>Cauſum,</hi> attended by all that waited on him at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> excepting the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who voluntarily abſented himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Houſe according to the Kings requeſt, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Children to goe to him, and the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to attend them; his Majeſty was Joyfull at the ſight of his Children.</p>
            <p>The Generall being in the preſence Chamber was much reſpected, which moved the Princeſs to aske who it was, who being Inform'd it was the Generall, ſhe immediately addreſt her ſelfe to him with great civilitie, and thankt him for this great happineſſe, that ſhe then enjoyed the ſight
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170342:69"/>of her deare Father, effected by him alone, which ſhe ſhould ever thankfully acknowledge, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to requite.</p>
            <p>The Generall return'd humble thankes, and that what he had done was but the leaſt of thoſe duties he was oblig'd to ſerve his Majeſty and Children in, and kiſſing her Hand withdrew.</p>
            <p>The Eleven Members diſcharge themſelves of their charge, and require leave of the Houſe to goe beyond Sea, which was conſented too.</p>
            <p>Upon the Armyes removing to <hi>Bedford,</hi> his Majeſty was brought to <hi>Wooborne,</hi> a Houſe of the Lord of <hi>Bedfords,</hi> with his old attendance.</p>

            <p>The City petitions the Generall.</p>
            <p>The Generall requires all the Forts from <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> to the <hi>Thames,</hi> to be delivered up to him, that he might Guard the Parliament, and ſecure the eleven Members.</p>

                  <p>Liberty being that which in all times hath been, but eſpecially now is the condition, the aym and deſire of all men, common reaſon
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170342:72"/>ſhews that Kings, leſſe then any, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure captivity; yet I call God to witneſſe, with what patience I have endur'd a tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which ſo long as I had any hopes that this ſort of my ſuffering might conduce to the peace of my Kingdomes, or the hindring of more effuſion of blood, I did willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe; but now finding by too certaine proofes, that this my continued patience, muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne to my perſonall ruine, but likewiſe be of more prejudice then furtherance to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, I thought I was bound as well by naturall as politicall obligations, to ſeeke my ſafety, by retiring my ſelfe ſometime from the publique view, both of my friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and I appeale to all indifferent men to judge, if I have not juſt cauſe to free my ſelfe from the hands of thoſe, who change their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with their condition, and who are not aſham'd openly to Intend the deſtruction of Nobility by taking away their negative voyce, and with whom the <hi>Levellers</hi> Doctrine is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countenanc't then puniſht, and for their Intentions to my perſon, their charging and putting more ſtrict Guards upon me, with the diſcharging moſt of all thoſe ſervants of mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to waite on me, doe ſufficiently declare; nor would I have this my retirement miſ-interpreted, for I ſhall earneſtly and unceſſantly endeavour theſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170342:73"/>things for a ſafe &amp; well-grounded peace, where ever I am, or ſhall be (and that as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an blood, for which how many times have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, yea preſt to be heard, &amp; yet no ear given me; and can any reaſonable man thinke that according to the ordinary courſe of affaires, there can be a ſetled peace without it, or that God will bleſſe thoſe who refuſe to heare their own King, ſurely no. Nay I muſt further add, that (beſides what concernes my ſelfe) unleſſe all other chiefe Intereſts have not onely a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but likewiſe juſt ſatisfaction given unto them, (to wit, the <hi>Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> Army, thoſe who have adhered to me, and even the <hi>Scots</hi>) I ſay there cannot (I ſpeake not of miracles, it being in my opinion a ſimple perſwaſion in ſuch caſes to expect or truſt to them) be a ſafe and laſting peace. Now I cannot deny but that as my perſonall ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of my retirement, ſo I call God to witneſſe, that the publique peace is no leſſe before my eyes, and I can finde no better way to expreſſe this my profeſſion (I know not what a wiſer man can do) then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and urging, that all chiefe Intereſts may be heard, to the end each may have ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as for example, the Army (for the reſt though neceſſary, yet I ſuppoſe are not difficult to content) ought in my judgement to injoy

            <p>His abſence ſtruck all into amazement; The Parliament order his neere attendance to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint untill examination; all the Sea-ports to be layd to prevent his Majeſties Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe Voted that whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his Majeſty, ſhall forfeit Life and eſtate.</p>
            <p>Every one was big with Expectation to know what was become of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>On the 15 of <hi>October,</hi> 1647. Information was brought to the Houſe that his Majeſty was ſafe at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and had put himſelfe into the protection of Colonell <hi>Hamond,</hi> then Governour of the Iſland.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty told the Governour, that there was a deſigne againſt his perſon, which moved him to fly thither for ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons were well ſatisfied
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170342:74"/>with his Majeſties being there; and Order thoſe ſervants that attended him at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> to attend him there.</p>
            <p>On the 18 of <hi>November,</hi> his Majeſty ſent a Letter to the Parliament, and another to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, giving them to underſtand of his being, as he apprehended, in more ſafety there then at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and doth profeſſe his readineſſe as to an agreement, and though he cannot conſent to alter the Government by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops and Biſhops, neither as a Chriſtian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Apoſtolicall, nor as a King, becauſe at his Coronation he ſwore to maintaine this order, yet he is willing to conſent, that their power be ſo limited that they be not grievous to tender Conſciences. For the ſale of Church Lands, he accounts it ſacriledge, that it ſubverts the Intent of the Donors, diſcourages learning; He is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Presbytery</hi> be continued for three yeares, provided thoſe that cannot concur be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, and that a free debate be had with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and twenty that he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, to reſolve how Church Government here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be ſetled, with full Liberty to all that differ, yet without toleration of Popery, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, or blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>He is willing to put the <hi>Militia</hi> both by Sea and Land to be diſpoſed of by his two Houſes, or who they ſhall appoint for his Reigne, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it returne to his Succeſſors; that it be limited to ſuppreſſe diſturbance in this Kingdome, and againſt forraine Invaſion, and that the power goe from his Majeſty by Grant of Patent to thoſe that act.</p>
            <p>He is willing and conſenting to the payment of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170342:74"/>the arreares of the Army, and that he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to raiſe 400000 <hi>l.</hi> in eightteen moneths, and if that will not doe, he is willing to give way for the ſale of Forreſt Lands; and for payment of other debts his Majeſty is willing to paſſe ſuch an Act as both Houſes ſhall conſent to.</p>
            <p>He is willing the Parliament doe chooſe privie Councellers during his Reigne, provided they have their Pattent from him.</p>
            <p>He is willing the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> be taken away, provided there be a valuable conſideration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, and that care may be had of his Children, who were by that Court cared for.</p>
            <p>And that the memory of theſe late ſad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions may be quite wiped away, he is willing to Null all Oaths, Declarations, Proclamations, againſt both or either Houſes of Parliament, or any Inditement againſt any for adhering to them.</p>
            <p>And his Majeſty offers as the beſt expedient, an Act of oblivion to all his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>And although his Majeſty cannot in Honour and Juſtice make voyd all his Acts and Grants under his Seale, ſince the 22 of <hi>May</hi> 1642. yet he doubts not but upon peruſall, to give full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his two Houſes in that.</p>
            <p>And thus he conceives he hath ſatisfied all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, for other things that may be propoſ'd to him from both Houſes of Parliament, on his part he moves earneſtly for a perſonall Treaty at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> all which being done, he believes the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will thinke it reaſonable to thinke of ſuch Propoſalls as were made by the Army, touching the ſucceſſion of Parliaments, and their due E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170342:75"/>
            <p> For the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he is ready to give ſatisfaction to what ſhall be propounded.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>Scots</hi> ſent a Letter to the Parliament, that they Regret that no anſwer is given to their Letter, and that they are inform'd that Propoſitions are to be ſent without allowing any competent time to conſider. They take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Majeſties being carried from <hi>Holmbey,</hi> and his juſt cauſe of going from <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> And in regard the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> are highly concern'd in the ſafety of his Majeſties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in duty bound to doe their beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ruine, they therefore deſire his Majeſty may come to <hi>London,</hi> to treate with Honour, freedome and ſafety, and that neither he nor his Parliament be Inviron'd with Souldiers, that ſo their conſultations being free, all differences may be ended by a perſonall Treaty, the beſt way to ſettle a ſure and laſting peace.</p>
            <p>See the uncertainty of men in the world, that thoſe very <hi>Scots</hi> that had not long before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was altogether Inconvenient for the Parliament to admit his Majeſty to come to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> untill he had given ſatisfaction to their juſt and reaſonable deſires, ſhould now deſire the King to come to <hi>London,</hi> which at that time ſwarm'd with Malignants, apt for any tumult, nay the Parliament it ſelfe at that time could not ſit with ſafety, without an Army to guard them.</p>
            <p>On the 23 of <hi>November,</hi> 1647. both Houſes Voted not to have any perſonall Treaty with his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Yet after three dayes debate in the Houſe, they conclude that foure Propoſitions be drawne
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170342:75"/>up in forme of Acts, to be ſent to his Majeſty to ſigne, which when he had ſigned, they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a perſonall Treaty at <hi>London.</hi> The Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That a Bill may be paſt into an Act by his Majeſty for ſetling the</hi> Militia <hi>of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Bill be paſt by his Majeſty, calling in all his Declarations, Oathes, Proclamations againſt the Parliament, and thoſe that have adhered to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To paſſe an Act that thoſe Lords who were made after the Great Seale was carried to</hi> Oxford, <hi>may be made uncapable of ſitting in the Houſe of Peeres thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That power may be given to the two Houſes to adjurne, as the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall thinke fit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 30 of <hi>November,</hi> the King ſent a Letter to the Generall and Army, by Sir <hi>John Barkley,</hi> deſiring their furtherance of a perſonall treaty, with a promiſe of Recompence when all ſhould be ſetled. To which anſwer was return'd, that they had wholly left it to the Parliament, and that they would be paſſive.</p>
            <p>The Army ſent a large Declaration to both Houſes, taxing them with neglect, contrary to promiſe, and laying forth the wants of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by reaſon they had not expedited their pay, which muſt neceſſitate them to take free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and be burthenſome to the ſubjects, if not by them timely prevented.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170342:76"/>
            <p> His Majeſty ſent another Letter to the Lords, wherein he expreſſeth himſelfe, that if any thing had been of more concernment then the peace of this Kingdome, he would with patience have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an anſwer to his former Letter, but his tender affection to his ſubjects welfare, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency with him to preſſe a perſonall Treaty, and Intimates, that if the Houſes pleaſe that he come among them, it will no doubt ſpeed a good end.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons according to their former order, Vote the Lord <hi>Qenbigh,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> for the Upper Houſe, Mr <hi>Liſle,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Goodwin,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Bulncley,</hi> for the Commons, to carry the four Propoſitions to his Majeſty, which if he ſigne they will admit of a perſonall Treaty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners likewiſe went to his Majeſty, and after ſome conference with him, declare againſt the four Bills to this effect;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they had endeavour'd by all wayes and meanes with the Parliament of</hi> England <hi>for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a happy peace, but having ſeene the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions now brought to his Majeſty, they apprehend them to be prejudiciall to Religion, the Crowne, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion betwixt both Kingdomes, and therefore in the name of the Kingdome of</hi> Scotland <hi>declare their diſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Hamond</hi> wrote a Letter to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that he could not ſecure his Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would allow him more ſtrength, there being ſo great a concourſe into the Iſleland; upon which the Commons order, that his Majeſties perſon be ſecured, and more Forces be ſent for the ſecurity of the Iſland.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170342:76"/>
            <p> The Commiſſioners return'd with a large Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from his Majeſty, ſhewing the Grounds and reaſons why he cannot paſſe any thing till the whole Treaty be concluded on, profeſſing he is willing to give any reaſonable ſatisfaction to whatſoever ſhall be requir'd.</p>
            <p>He now againe earneſtly preſſes <hi>for a perſonall Treaty, of which he will not deſpaire, there being no viſible way left for the Kingdomes peace, but by it; However, his Majeſty is at peace and quietneſſe within himſelfe, in having fulfild the offices both of a Chriſtian, and a King, and will patiently waite the good pleaſure of Almightie God, to incline the hearts of his two Houſes to conſider their King, and compaſſionate their fellow ſubjects miſeries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its very obſervable that his Majeſty received the Parliaments Commiſſioners very gratefully, deſiring them all to be aſſiſtants to him in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a wel=grounded peace, the expreſſion he ſaid was theirs, but it was a very good one; he tould them, there were many Intereſts to be conſidered of, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Parliament, Army, and <hi>Scots,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd all might be conſidered; but when he was inform'd of a diſſenting Declaration of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he tould them, he was very ſorry for it, and he hoped they might agree in the maine, though they might differ in circumſtances. His Majeſty deliver'd his Meſſage to the Commiſſioners o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, with Injunction to keep it ſecret till they had deliver'd it to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>There hapned a tumult at <hi>Newport</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> diverſe declaring for the King, and one Captain <hi>Burleigh</hi> cauſed a drum to be beaten up for the ſervice of his Majeſty; the Mayor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that came to his aſſiſtance, fell upon them,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170342:77"/>diſperſt them, took the Captain, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards executed.</p>
            <p>This tumult cauſed the Governour of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land immediately to diſcharge all ſuch as had ayded and aſſiſted his Majeſty in the late War againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Munday the third of <hi>January,</hi> 1657. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons tok into conſideration his Majeſties Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and finding the ſame as it appeares to them, not ſatisfactory, nor that he hath any Inclination to a compoſure, it was put to the Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any addreſſes ſhould be made hereafter;</hi> after many houres debate it was Reſolv'd;</p>
            <p>That 1. <hi>No addreſſes ſhall hereafter be made to him by the Parliament of</hi> England.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That none ſhall on paine of Treaſon, make any addreſſe without leave from the Parliament.</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham</hi> had ſeazed on <hi>Carlile</hi> for the King, and Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> was come as far as <hi>Appleby</hi> with a formidable Army.</p>

            <p>A party of old Souldiers were drawne out to face the Towne, whilſt the body was drawne up, ready to receive the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The old Souldiers aſſaulted the Towne by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at night, where they met with men of like Reſolution, there being the ſtouteſt men of the Enemies Army, Apprentices and Seamen, and ſuch as had been in Armes for the King.</p>
            <p>The fight continued for ſix houres, they vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly diſputed in every ſtreete; at laſt the Towne is taken, with the loſs of ſixty men; in it were taken 1300 priſoners, diverſe of quality, 400 Horſe, eight pieces of Ordinance, with good ſtore of booty.</p>
            <p>The Generall ſhewed perſonall Valour by Charging in his ſlippers.</p>
            <p>Many of the Kentiſh forces march over <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> bridge toward <hi>London,</hi> where on Black heath they muſter a conſiderable Army, whither many apprentices and reſolute perſons repaire, under the Command of old <hi>Goring.</hi>

            <p>Thoſe with <hi>Goring</hi> being denied a paſſage over <hi>London</hi> bridge, come over on <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſide, ſecure <hi>Bow</hi> bridge with a ſmall party, whilſt the reſt march further into the County.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Owen</hi> in <hi>North-Wales</hi> endeavours to raiſe forces for the King, which the Sheriffe of a County Indeavoured to impede, but being too

            <p>And to ſay truth, as things then ſtood, it was of a conſiderable value, as to the ſervice of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>On the 13 of <hi>July</hi> Marqueſſe <hi>Hamilton</hi> enterd <hi>England</hi> with an Army of 9000 Horſe and foote, the Generality of the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> were wholly averſe to it, the Miniſters every where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the Duke.</p>

            <p>On the 18 of <hi>July,</hi> the Commons conſider'd of a perſonall treaty with his Majeſty, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving duly weighed all the Inconveniences that might ariſe by his Majeſties coming to <hi>London,</hi> and duly conſiderd all the objections againſt his Majeſties granting the three Propoſitions before the Treaty, they reſolv'd that the Treaty ſhould be in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and that it be with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, freedome and ſafety; they appointed a Committee to conſider of time, manner, and place.</p>

He conjures them is Chriſtians, and good Patricts, that they will make all poſſible expedition, by haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe their Commiſſioners, praying the God of peace to bleſſe all endeavours, that all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may enjoy a ſafe and happy peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A deſigne was laid for the betraying of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> for the King, but by the Induſtry of Captain <hi>Stone</hi> it was prevented.</p>

            <p>The next morning the Enemy came within two miles of <hi>Warington,</hi> where they drew up in a very ſtrong field, which had high banks like forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; where <hi>O ſwold</hi> King of the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> was formerly ſlaine.</p>
            <p>We fell upon them, though with very great diſadvantage, our Horſe Charge Reſolutely; The diſpute was long and ſharp, untill ſuch time as the foote could come up to engage, which no ſooner came but they retire, and we purſued them to <hi>Warington</hi> bridge; there was kild of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my above a thouſand, and above two thouſand taken priſoners, the reſt fled over <hi>Warington</hi> bridge, where the foote were left by the Horſe, who fled; upon our advance they ſent a parly, and above 4000 well accoutred men with the Lieutenant Generall laid downe their Armes, and ſubmitted to mercy.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Towne of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> having held out the longeſt ſiege of any Towne in <hi>England</hi> ſince the firſt beginning of the troubles, in Expectation of Relief from the North; but the <hi>Scots</hi> Colours being brought before the Towne, totally diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them of their Expectation, and being by famine the ſoreſt of Calamities, compeld to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Towne up to mercy (they having ſed neere ten dayes together on Horſ-fleſh) The Great ones endeavouring to eſcape were turn'd back by their own men.

            <p>The Generall permitting the Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to depart with life, and the Officers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at his diſpoſall, he to exempt from mercy whom he pleaſed, the remainder to be remitted to the mercy of the Parliament.</p>

            <p>The miſeries of the Towne were great, there being hardly ſo much as Horſ-bread leſt to have preſerv'd them alive one day.</p>
            <p>On the 28 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at a Councell of War, it was reſolv'd that Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> and Sir <hi>Barnard Jaſkin,</hi> a Papiſt, be ſhot to death.</p>
            <p>And accordingly Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> was brought out into the Caſtle yard, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon an appeale, but being deni'd, he took
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170342:88"/>Courage, and looking death in the face with an undaunted reſolution, ſubmitted himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Liſle</hi> was next brought forth, who Kiſt Sir <hi>Charles</hi> being dead, and after private prayer deſir d a ſpeedy death, more deſperate then many of the ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> on Record.</p>

            <p>The Commons order a Letter to be ſent to his Majeſty, with the names of the Commiſſioners, withall letting him know how far they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Treaty.</p>
            <p>They further conſidered of Inſtructions for the Treaty, and require money of the City to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the Charge.</p>
            <p>The Prince Riding in the Downs with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted ſhips, ſent a ſummons to the Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to tender and ſubmit himſelfe to the Kings Majeſty, for the better ſecurity and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdome. The Lord Admirall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes anſwer, that God-willing he will performe the truſt repoſed in him; and for ſetling the Kingdome, he leaves that to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 11. a Petition was preſented to the Commons, entituled, <hi>The humble Petition of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands well affected in the City of London,</hi> giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Reaſons why they aſſiſted them in the war with their lives and fortunes, giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they expected other meanes for a ſettlement, then a perſonall Treaty; as likewiſe taking particular notice of the ſeverall wants and neceſſities of the Nation, concluding that they had laid to heart the blood and loſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and wiſht them ſeriouſly to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an act of oblivion will ſatisfie Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and appeaſe his wrath.</p>
            <p>Which Petition was laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Money being provided, on the 14 of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the Commiſſioners ſet forward for the <hi>Iſle
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170342:89"/>of Wight,</hi> forty dayes was the time limited; his Majeſty deſir'd that the firſt day, on which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was performed but viſits, might not be reckoned for one of the forty.</p>
            <p>The next day the Perſonall Treaty began, and it may very well be call'd <hi>Perſonall,</hi> for was it ever knowne that a King of <hi>England</hi> argued and diſputed alone with able men ſelected out of the Parliament, they perſonally to argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> with a King?</p>
            <p>His Majeſty being ſeated in a Chair of State, thoſe his aſſiſtants by him were ſilent.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty deſir'd a Copy of the Heads that they came to treat upon, the Commiſſioners an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they were the ſame with thoſe at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty replyed, ſome of thoſe Heads concern'd <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Commiſſioners ſaid they came to treat onely of thoſe that concern'd <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King deſir'd the <hi>Scots</hi> might be Inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; to which the Commiſſioners anſwered, they had no Inſtructions to permit it; his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty further deſired that what papers he might put in during the Treaty, might be no way obliging till ſuch time as all was agreed.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners Inſiſted on the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which was, <hi>that his Majeſty ſhould recall all his Declarations;</hi> to which he brought many preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing arguments, profeſſing he was in a very great ſtraight, to yeild would leave a blot and ſtaine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe and thoſe that aſſiſted him, and to breake off the Treaty upon that, would be very prejudiciall to him, and the whole Kingdome, deſiring ſome expedient might be found out.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170342:90"/>The next day the Commiſſioners gave weighty reaſons to his Majeſty, which mov'd him to ſigne it with this proviſo, that if the whole was not concluded, this conceſſion of his ſhould not be taken advantage of.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition wholly related to the ſettlement of the Church, which being very long took ſome time; In it he ſcrupled at two things, firſt at his own taking the Covenant; the ſecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pluralities, much wondring that this ſhould be put on him, when the Parliament had granted more pluralities to ſome men, then ever he did to any: after much ſerious conſideration, the King gave in a Paper, wherein he agreed; Firſt, to ſettle the Directory; ſecondly, to paſſe an Act to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Aſſembly; thirdly, that <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be ſetled for three yeares, in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, a conſultation be had what Government ſhall be ſetled at the expiration of the three yeares, provided he and his party may have Liberty to uſe the old forme; he liked not the ſale of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lands for ninety nine years, and utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the Covenant; Further, adding that when he came to <hi>London</hi> he ſhould be willing to paſſe any thing that his two Houſes ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to.</p>
            <p>As to the Propoſition for taking away all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſince 1642. his Majeſty is conſenting that all perſons on whom Honours have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſince <hi>May</hi> 21. 1642. ſhall be uncapable of ſitting in the Houſe without the conſent of both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Concerning Delinquents his Majeſty conſents that all perſons that have had any hand in the plotting contrary deſignes, or aſſiſting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170342:90"/>of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall expect no pardon.</p>
            <p>For Delinquents his Majeſty deſires they may compound moderately for their Eſtates; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the quiet and ſettlement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, his Majeſty is willing that all thoſe Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents whom the Parliament ſhall not thinke fit, be not admitted to Councell or Court without the conſent of both Houſes.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners being bound up to receive a poſitive anſwer, durſt not accept of that.</p>
            <p>Divers meetings and arguings were on both ſides, for and againſt; at laſt on the 21 of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the King put in a Paper containing the Heads of thoſe things that he requir'd, which were:
<list>
                  <item>1. That he be put in a condition of freedome, Honour and ſafety, and have the faith of the two Houſes therefore.</item>
                  <item>2. That he may be reſtored to his Lands and Revenues.</item>
                  <item>3. That he may have compenſation for the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> and ſuch other of his revenue as he ſhall part withall.</item>
                  <item>4. An Act of Oblivion and Indempnity be paſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which Propoſitions the Commiſſioners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Lords, who upon debate finde them to be ſo reaſonable, as to conſent to them all; They likewiſe Informe the Houſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties anſwer to Religion, and the Covenant, which the Houſe Vote not ſatisfactory, and will by no meanes permit him the uſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, but for the Covenant they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſuſpend it, but order the Commiſſioners to proceed on the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Lords Vote that they approve of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170342:91"/>ſuſpenſion of Epiſcopacy for three yeares, provided it take no place afterward but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Lords and Commons Vote their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners returne from the Treaty, excepting the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Perepoint,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hollis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commons debated of his Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and Vote that they agree.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he be in Honour, freedome and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to the Laws.</item>
               <item>2. That he have his revenue as before, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Dedications of ſuch Forts and Garriſons, as were of old accuſtom'd to be allow'd mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</item>
               <item>3. That he have compenſation for the Court of <hi>Wards.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That an Act of Oblivion be paſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All which they communicate to the Lords.</p>
            <p>The King having Granted the Parliament to diſpoſe of all Great Offices for ten yeares, they Vote it ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> enters <hi>Scotland,</hi> and puts out ſtrict Proclamation for the Civill deportment of his Army; He no ſooner enters the Kingdome, but <hi>Monroe</hi> and others diſpairing of ſucceſſe, disband the new Levies, and returne malancholly to <hi>Edenborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Generall was with many of the Officers of the Army Nobly feaſted by the Nobility and Gentry of that Nation at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſend Commiſſioners to <hi>London,</hi> to the Parliament, to ſhew their Juſt diſlike of the late Levies.</p>

            <p>The Committee of <hi>York</hi> Petition the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall to take care of the ſiege of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret,</hi> who accordingly ſent a ſharp ſummons to the Governour, to which the Governour ſent a Reply, which in effect was a deniall.</p>
            <p>Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> Reports to the Houſe the great danger they were in, by reaſon of the great concourſe of Malignants and diſaffected perſons into the City, together with the plots tending to aſſaſſinate many of the Members, and of his Inability to aſſiſt them without a Guard, requiring if they thinke it convenient, that ſome of the Army come to Guard them, upon which the Houſe appointed a time to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>The Complaint of the Country every where was very Great, by reaſon of free quarter, which the Officers of the Army upon ſerious Inſpection, diſcover a deſigne to ſtop their pay, to make them more odious to the people.</p>
            <p>At a Councell of War held at the <hi>Bull</hi> in St <hi>Albanes,</hi> where were preſent ſixteen Colonels, beſides other Officers, a Declaration was read of all their Grivances, and deſires, containing 26 ſheets of Paper, which was orderd to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>The Commons order the drawing of ſeverall Acts to be ſign'd by his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As, 1. An Act for Juſtifying the War made by Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An Act for Nulling all Honours, ſince the carrying away of the Great Seale.</p>

The Commiſſioners againe preſs upon the King, to which he replies, that he had given his anſwer already, and could not with a ſafe conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the aboliſhing of Biſhops, nor approve of the alienating of their Lands, becauſe he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the firſt is Apoſtolicall, the ſecond ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious. He further tould them, that if his two Houſes will not recede from their former Votes, and content themſelves ſatisfied in order to peace, He can be content <hi>with Chriſt to ſuffer any thing that can befall him, rather then deprive himſelfe of the tranquility of Conſcience,</hi> ſtill hoping that the Parliament will conſent.</p>
            <p>To which the Commiſſioners anſwer that the Parliament conceive it neceſſary that his Majeſty grant their requeſt for the peace and welfare of the Kingdom, aſſuring that it is not the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Biſhop which they require, but the Biſhop
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170342:92"/>eſtabliſht by Law, growne up to that height of pride and ſtate, Inſulting over all power, and burthenſome to the perſons and eſtates of the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>And for alienating Biſhops Lands, they anſwer, they were ſettled by Law, and by Law may be alienated, and that it was an ordinary practice of his Majeſties Predeceſſors in the Caſe of Abby Lands.</p>
            <p>On the 26 of <hi>November,</hi> was preſented a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Army to the Commons Houſe, which was the day before ſubſcribed by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, it contained 26 ſheets of paper, ſhewing <hi>the miſgoings of King &amp; Parliament ſeverally, alſo in all Treaties betwixt them, eſpecially that they are now in: They conceive the Parliament hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant cauſe to lay aſide any further proceedings in this Treaty, and to returne to their Votes of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addreſſes, and ſettle with or againſt the King, that he was Governe no more, by rejecting thoſe demands of the King, eſpecially concerning his reſtitution, and coming to</hi> London <hi>with freedome, Honour and ſafety, and that they proceed againſt the King in way of Juſtice, and that a peremptory day be ſet for the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>and Duke of</hi> York <hi>to come in, if not, to be declared uncapable of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtand Exiled for ever as traytors.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> I would know by what Power I was cald hither; I was not long agoe in the <hi>Iſle of Wright,</hi> how I came thither is too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or then I thinke now to ſpeak of; there I was in treaty with both Houſes of Parliament, was as much publique faith as its poſſible, we were almoſt come to the Concluſion of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I would now know by what Authority, <hi>I meane lawfull,</hi> for there are many unlawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in the world, <hi>theeves and robbers by the high way;</hi> but I would know by what Lawfull authority I was brought from thence, and carried from place to place, and when I know by what Lawfull Authority, I ſhall anſwer: Remember, I am your King, and what ſins you bring upon your heads, and what Judgements upon this Land, thinke well upon it; I ſay, thinke well upon it, before you goe from one ſin to a greater; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me know by what Lawfull Authority I am ſeated here; In the meane time I ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray my truſt, I have a truſt committed to me by God, by old and Lawfull deſcent, I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it, by anſwering to a new and Unlawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Preſident,</hi> If you had been pleaſed to have obſerv'd what had been hinted to you by the Court at your firſt coming hither, you would have knowne by what Authority. Which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority requires you in the name of the people of <hi>England,</hi> by which you are Elected King, to anſwer them.</p>

               <hi>Lord Preſident,</hi> If you acknowledge not the Authority of the Court, they muſt proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> I doe tell them ſo, <hi>England</hi> is an hereditary and not an Elective Kingdome, and hath been ſo neare 1000 yeares; therefore let me know by what Authority I am cald hither; I ſtand more for the priviledge of my people, than any that are ſeated here; ſtill urging to know by what Authority he was ſeated there, and he would anſwer; otherwiſe not.</p>

               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Charges the King with Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Court, which did not beſeeme him in that condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King</hi> tould him, he was brought from the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> by force, and he did not come there as ſubmitting to the Court, profeſſing to ſtand for the priviledge of the Houſe of Commons, ſtill urging a Legall Authority, warranted by the Word of God, or the Conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and he would Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Seeing you will not anſwer, the Court will conſider how to proceed; in the meane time, you are to be carried away by them that brought you hither.</p>
            <p>The Court deſires to know whether this is all you will anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> Sir, I deſire you would Give me and all the world ſatisfaction in this, its no ſleight thing you are about, I am ſworne to God for the peace of my Country, and therefore you would doe well to ſatisfie God, and then the world by what Authority you doe this, there is a God in Heaven that will call you and all that Gives you power to account.</p>

               <hi>The King,</hi> That which you have ſaid, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no reaſonable man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> That's in your apprehenſion, we thinke it reaſonable that are your Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> Neither your apprehenſion nor mine ought to decide it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Two dayes after on the 22 of <hi>January,</hi> the Court meet in the painted Chamber; where they order that the <hi>King ſhall not be ſufferd to argue the Juriſdiction of the Court, and that in caſe the King ſhould againe diſpute their Authority, the Preſident is to let him know, that the Court hath conſider'd his demands the last day, and that he ought to reſt ſatisfied with this anſwer, That the Commons of</hi> England <hi>aſſembled in Parliament have conſtituted this Court, whoſe power may not, nor ſhall not be diſputed againſt by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, <hi>That in caſe the King ſhall not anſwer, the Preſident is to let him know, that the Court doth take it as a contumacy, and record it, and in caſe he anſwer with a ſaving notwithſtanding of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prerogative above the Juriſdiction of the Court, the Preſident to refuſe his proteſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his poſitive anſwer whether he will own the Court or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in caſe the King ſhall continue in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, The Preſident ſhall command the Clarke to

            <p>And forthwith the Court aſſembles in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall,</hi> where after their Names are cald over, the Captaine of the Guard is commanded to fetch the King, who being brought and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as before, a Great ſhout was made by the people; Soliciter <hi>Cooke</hi> againe accuſeth the King as before, the Charge being Read, he required he might give a poſitive anſwer, which if he refuſe, the Charge to be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and the Court proceed to Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Requires the King to give a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anſwer, and either confeſſe or deny, it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd in behalfe of the Kingdome to be made good againſt you, for the Authority of the Court they avow it, and the whole Kingdome are to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it, I therefore require your poſitive anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King</hi> perſiſted in his former proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Juriſdiction of the Court, and that a King could not be tryed by any ſuperior Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction on Earth, and tould them that pretend what they would be ſtood for their Liberties; for if <hi>Power without Law</hi> may alter the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Laws of the Kingdome, what ſubject is he that can be ſecure of his Life or Eſtate; and going to ſhew reaſons why he could not allow them a Court, he was Interrupted by the <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> who tould him they would not allow him to diſpute the Authority of the Court, deſiring a

            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> I underſtand Law and reaſon, and therefore under favour I doe plead for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people more then you doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould Impoſe a beliefe upon any man without reaſons given for it, it were unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The <hi>Preſident</hi> againe Interrupted him, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he might not be permitted to ſpeake of Law and reaſon there; The Vote of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament are the reaſon of the Kingdome: Sir, you are not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our Authority, and it will be taken notice of that you ſtand in contempt of the Court, and your contempt will be recorded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King,</hi> I doe not know how a King can be a Delinquent by any Law, I ever heard of, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be heard my reaſons, if you deny that you deny reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Sir, Neither you nor any man ſhall be permitted to diſpute the Authority of the Court; further telling him that if he demurr'd to the Juriſdiction of the Court, they ſitting there by the Authority of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> he and all his Predeceſſors are reſponſible to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> I deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> You ought to diſturbe or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the Court in ſpeaking; They have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd of their own Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King,</hi> I ſay, Sir, The Commons of <hi>England</hi> were never allow'd a Court of Judicature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Sir, you are not to be permitted to goe on in theſe diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Then the Clarke Read as was Ordered in the painted Chamber, requiring the King to anſwer;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170342:99"/>Upon which the King promiſed to anſwer, ſo ſoone as he knew the Authority of the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> If that be all you have to ſay, then take away the Priſoner; To which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I require to give in my Reaſons, which the <hi>Preſident</hi> would not permit; The King urges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to give in his Reaſons, but the <hi>Preſident</hi> tould him his Reaſons were not to be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the higheſt Juriſdiction.

            <p>
               <hi>The Preſident</hi> againe commands the Priſoner to be taken away, who was accordingly convey'd back to S <hi>James's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Preſident</hi> ordered to record the default.</p>
            <p>On the 23 of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. The Court met againe according to the uſuall manner, and the Priſoner was brought with his Guard, and ſeated in his Chaire; Soliciter <hi>Cooke</hi> made a formall Speech, addreſſing himſelfe to the <hi>Preſident,</hi> and in the Cloſe craved Judgement to be pronounced againſt the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preſident</hi> addreſſes himſelfe to the King, and tells him, That it was not for him to diſpute the Juriſdiction of the ſupreame and higheſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>England,</hi> from whom there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale; and further to let him know, that the Court was ſenſible of his delays, and that they ought not to be thus trifled with, and that they might in Juſtice take advantage of thoſe delays, and proceed to Judgement againſt him; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, by direction of the Court, I require a poſitive anſwer whether you are Guilty or not Guilty of the Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>King</hi> reply'd, when I was here
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170342:100"/>laſt I did deſire to ſpeake for the Liberties of the people of <hi>England,</hi> but was Interrupted, I deſire to know whether I may ſpeake freely or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, that you are not to be permitted to run out into any diſcourſes, untill ſuch time as you have given a poſitive anſwer to the matter that hath been Charg'd upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> For the Charge I value it not a ruſh, its the Liberty of the people I ſtand for, I that am your King, and ſworne to maintaine the Laws, for me to acknowledge a new Court that I never heard of; <hi>here he was Interrupted.</hi> Sir, you ought not to Interrupt me; How I came here I know not, there is no Law for it, to make your King your Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Sir, you muſt know the pleaſure of the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> By your favour Sir.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Nay Sir, by your favour you may not be permitted to fall into theſe diſcourſes; The Court once more demands your poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Here the Clarke Read the ſame as before.</p>
            <p>To which the King replyed; To give ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the people of the Cleareneſſe of my proceedings, not by way of anſwer, but to ſatisfie them that I have done nothing againſt the truſt that hath been committed to me, but to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a new Court againſt their priviledge, or to alter the fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome, you muſt excuſe me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> Sir, This is the third time you have diſownd the Court, and put an affront upon it; how far you have preſerv'd the priviledge of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170342:100"/>people your actions have ſpoke it; mens Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are knowne by their actions, you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your meaning in bloody Characters; but Sir, The pleaſure of the Court is, that the Clarke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord your default, and you Gentlemen that take Charge of the Priſoner, take him away.</p>
            <p>Who was Immediately convey'd back to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James's</hi> as accuſtomd.</p>
            <p>On the 27 of <hi>January,</hi> 1648. The Court met againe in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> being in all ſeventy eight.</p>

            <p>Silence being Commanded at the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Court, there was a great Cry made in the Hall for Execution, Execution.</p>
            <p>The King deſir'd to ſpeake, and hopes he ſhall give no occaſion of Interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> You may, but you muſt heare the Court firſt; the King preſſes to be heard before Judgement, to which the <hi>Preſident</hi> promiſed he ſhould.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:170342:101"/>
            <p> Then the <hi>Preſident</hi> began his Speech, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to the Court, how that the Priſoner at the Bar hath been ſeverall times Charg'd with Treaſon in the name of the people of <hi>England,</hi> and requir'd to anſwer; That he hath been ſo far from obeying the Court by ſubmitting to their Juſtice, that he began to offer reaſoning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate unto the Authority of the Court, and being requir'd to anſwer, he was pleaſed to be contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and refuſed to anſwer; whereupon the Court have thought fit to take the matter into their conſideration, and have conſiderd of the Notoriouſneſſe of the fact Charg'd upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and upon the whole, are agreed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, of a ſentence to be pronounced on this Priſoner, but in reſpect he deſires to be heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſentence, the Court are reſolv'd to heare him, provided he meddle not with the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court, but if he have any thing to ſay in his own defence, the Court is willing to heare him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King</hi> tells them, a haſty ſentence once paſt, may ſooner be Repented then recald, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring he might be heard in the Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before the Lords and Commons. I cannot be Judge of that I have to ſay, but if it be reaſon, and really <hi>for the welfare of the Kingdome, and Liberty of the ſubject,</hi> I am ſure it will be well worth the hearing before my ſentence be paſt, therefore I doe conjure you, as you love that you pretend, I hope its reall, <hi>the Liberty of the ſubject, and the peace of the Kingdome,</hi> that you will grant me a hearing before you paſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; to which the <hi>Preſident</hi> Reply'd, that it was a further declining of the Juriſdiction of the Court.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:170342:102"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>The King</hi> craving pardon for his Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, endeavour'd to cleere it, that it was not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Court, although he could not own it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Preſident</hi> tould him they had with much patience waited his leaſure as to an anſwer, and that what he had offerd tended to a delay, and ſuch delayes neither the Kingdome nor Juſtice could admit of, but the Court is content to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for a time, and you ſhall know their further pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Sarjeant at Arms declares from the Court, that the Priſoner was to be withdrawne, untill ſuch time as they ſhould ſend for him.</p>
            <p>After halfe an houres ſpace, the Court being ſet, The <hi>Preſident</hi> Commands the Sarjeant at Armes to ſend for the Priſoner, who being brought, The <hi>Preſident</hi> tould the King, that the Court had withdrawne <hi>pro forma Tantum,</hi> that they had conſiderd of what was offerd, and of their own Authority, which was founded by the ſupreame Authority of the Parliament of the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and that they had acted according to their Conceſſion, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne that you are to expect from them is, that they have been too much delay'd by you already, and Judges are no more to delay then to deny, and notwithſtanding what you have offerd, they are reſolv'd to proceed to puniſhment and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this is their unanimous reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> Sir, It is in vaine for me to diſpute, I know you have power enough, but it would have been for the Kingdomes peace, if you would have ſhewn the lawfulneſſe of your power; it is not my own good I look at, but the Kingdomes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170342:102"/>peace, and welfare; I doe put at your doores all the Inconveniences of a haſty ſentence, I confeſſe I have been here eight dayes, its but a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of a day or two more that may give the Kingdome peace, whereas a haſty Judgement may bring on that trouble and perpetuall Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to the Kingdome, that the child unborne may repent it, therefore once againe I deſire to be heard by the Lords and Commons in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> You have already received the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Judgement of the Court in it, they deſire to know if you have any thing more to ſay before ſentence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> If you will grant me this delay, I doubt not but to give ſome reaſonable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, therefore I require you as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it at the dreadfull day of Judgement, that you will conſider it.</p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Preſident</hi> replyed, If you have nothing more to ſay, we muſt proceed to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King,</hi> I have nothing more to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſident,</hi> The Court hath ſomething to ſay to you, though it will not be acceptable to you, dilating upon the Charge, and the ſeverall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars whereof the Priſoner was Guilty, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating his ſpeech with divers examples ſacred and prophane, that the people have depoſed, nay executed their Kings for miſ-government. In the Cloſe of which the King deſired to be heard (before ſentence) concerning thoſe Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations Charg'd upon him. The <hi>Preſident</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that his time was now paſt, and he was not far from ſentence. The King againe moves to be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170342:103"/>heard concerning thoſe Imputations; but the <hi>Preſident</hi> tould him that he not acknowledging them to be a Court, they could not admit of what he had to ſay; and further, Inſiſting upon his guilt, minding him what the Scripture ſaith, <hi>For to acquit the Guilty is of equall abomination as to condemne the Innocent:</hi> We may not acquit the Guilty, what ſentence the Law denounceth to a <hi>Traytor,</hi> a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and a <hi>Publique Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to the <hi>Country,</hi> that ſentence you are now to have read unto you, and that is the ſenſe of the Court.</p>
            <p>O yes, and filence Commanded, the <hi>Preſident</hi> appoints the Clarke to read the ſentence, which was;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whereas the Commons of</hi> England <hi>in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, have appointed them a High Court of Justice for the trying of</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>before whom he had been three times Convented, and at the firſt time a Charge of High Treaſon and other Crimes and miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours was read in behalfe of the Kingdome of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Reading the Charge. <hi>To which Charge he the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>refuſed ſeverall times to anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all which Treaſons and Crimes this Court doth adjudge that the ſaid</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Traytor, Murtherer, and a publique Enemy, ſhall be put to death by ſevering his head from his body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſentence being read, the <hi>Preſident</hi> tould him, The ſentence read, and publiſhed, is the Act, Sentence, Judgement, and reſolution of the whole Court; Upon which the Court ſtood up, aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the <hi>Preſident</hi> had ſaid.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:170342:103"/>
            <p> The King would have been heard, but the <hi>Preſident</hi> tould him he was not to be heard after ſentence, and forthwith commanded the Priſoner to be carried away, who was convey'd to <hi>White Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons why he could not conſent to the Court, are as followeth, which he Intended to deliver on Munday <hi>Jan.</hi> 22. in writing, but was not permitted.</p>
            <p>Having already made My proteſtations not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the illegality of this pretended Court, but alſo that no Earthly power can juſtly call Me (who am your KING) in queſtion as a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; I would not any more open My mouth upon this occaſion, more than to refer My ſelf to what I have ſpoken, were I alone in this caſe alone concerned. But the duty I owe to God in the preſervation of the true liberty of My people, will not ſuffer Me at this time to be ſilent: For, how can any free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> call Life, or any thing he poſſeſſeth, his own; if Power without Right daily make new, and abrogate the old fundamentall Law of the Land? which I now take to be the preſent caſe. Wherefore when I came hither, I expected that you would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have ſatisfied Me concerning theſe grounds which hinder Me to anſwer to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Impeachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge Me, nor indeed the meaneſt Man in <hi>England;</hi> for, I will not (like you) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing a reaſon, ſeek to impoſe a belief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on My Subjects.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:170342:104"/>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Hereabout I was ſtopt, &amp; not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note>There is no proceeding juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Man, but what is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by Gods Laws, or the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall Laws of the Country where he lives. Now I am moſt confident, that this dayes proceeding cannot be warranted by Gods Law, for on the contrary, the authority of obedience unto Kings is cleerly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and ſtrictly commanded both in the Old and New Teſtament; which if denied, I am ready inſtantly to prove: and for the Queſtion now in hand, there it is ſaid, That <hi>where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him, what doest thou? Eccleſ.</hi> 8.4. Then for the Laws of this Land, I am no leſſe confident, that no learned Lawyer will affirm, that an impeachment can lye againſt the King, they all going in His Name; and one of their Maximes is, <hi>That the King can do no wrong.</hi> Beſides, the Law upon which you ground your proceedings, muſt either be old or new: if old, ſhew it; if new, tell what Authority warranted by the fundamentall Laws of the Land hath made it, and when. But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was never one it ſelf (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge: And it were full as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Laws without King or Lords-Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Englands</hi> Commiſſion could grant your pretended power, I ſee nothing you can ſhew for that; for certainly you never asked the queſtion of the tenth man of the Kingdome, and in this way
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170342:104"/>you manifeſtly wrong even the pooreſt plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if you demand not his free conſent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your pretended Commiſſion without the conſent at leaſt of the major part of every man in <hi>England,</hi> of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quality or condition, which I am ſure you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about to ſeek; ſo far are you from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it. Thus you ſee that I ſpeak not for My own right alone, as I am your KING, but alſo for the true liberty of all My Subjects, which conſiſts not in ſharing the power of Government, but in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under ſuch Lawes, ſuch a Government as may give themſelves the beſt aſſurance of their lives, and propriety of their goods. Nor in this muſt or do I forget the Priviledges of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament, which this dayes proceeding doth not only violate, but likewiſe occaſion the greateſt breach of their publick Faith, that (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) ever was heard of, with which I am far from charging the two Houſes: for all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended crimes laid againſt Me, bear date long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving concluded as much as in Me lay, &amp; hopefully expecting the two Houſes agreement thereunto, I was ſuddenly ſurprized, and hurried from thence as a Priſoner, upon which account I am againſt My will brought hither, where ſince I am come I cannot but to My power defend the ancient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdome, together with My own juſt right; Than for any thing I can ſee the higher Houſe is totally excluded. And for the Houſe of Commons, it is too well known that the major part of them are detained or deterred from ſitting, ſo as if I had no other, this were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Me to proteſt againſt the lawfulneſſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170342:105"/>of your pretended Court. Beſides all this, the peace of the Kingdome is not the leaſt in My thoughts, and what hopes of ſettlement is there ſo long as Power reigns without rule of Law, changing the whole frame of that Government under which this Kingdome hath flouriſhed for many hundred yeares, (nor will I ſay what will fall out in caſe this lawleſſe unjuſt proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Me do go on) and believe it, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this change, for they will remember how happy they have been of late years under the Reign of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> the King My Father, and My Self, untill the beginning of theſe unhappy Troubles, and will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo happy under any new. And by this time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Arms I took up were only to defend the fundamentall Laws of this Kingdome, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed My power hath totally changed the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons, why I cannot ſubmit to your pretended Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without violating the truſt which I have from God, for the welfare and liberty of My People; I expect from you either cleer Reaſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince My judgement, ſhewing Me that I am in an Error (and then truly I will readily anſwer) or that you will withdraw your proceedings.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller, Harriſon, Deane,</hi> and <hi>Okey,</hi> Colonels, with Lieutenant Generall <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> are by the Court appointed to conſider of time and place for executing the King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that the Open ſtreete before <hi>White Hall</hi> is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170342:105"/>a fit place, and that the King be there executed the next day being the 30 of <hi>January</hi> 1648. and that the ſcaffold he covered with black.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 27. the King lay at <hi>White Hall,</hi> the next day being Sunday, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> preached before him in his Chamber; The ſame day all the Members of the Court kept a faſt in the Chappell at <hi>White Hall.</hi>

            <p>Tueſday the 30 of <hi>January,</hi> the fatall day, he prays and receives the Sacrament, and at ten a Clock attended by a Regiment of foote, and his Guard of Partiſons, with Biſhop <hi>Juxſon</hi> on one hand, and Colonell <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> on the other, walks afoote through the Parke; as they were going he bids them goe faſter, telling <hi>them he now went before them to ſtrive for a heavenly Crowne with leſs ſolicitude, then he had oftentimes bid his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to fight for an earthly Diadem;</hi> he goes into his Cabinet Chamber at <hi>White Hall,</hi> continuing in his devotions, refuſing to dine, but about twelve a Clock he eat a bit of bread and drank a glaſſe of claret wine; neere one of the Clock he was convey'd through the Banqueting-houſe, and paſt through the great window upon the ſcaffold co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with black, where he beheld two Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners diſguiſd with vizards, the Ax and Block ready, which nothing affrighted him; he addreſt himſelf to Colonell <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> as followeth.</p>
            <p>I Shall be very little heard of any body elſe, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a word unto you here: Indeed I could have held My peace very well, if I did not think that holding My peace would make
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170342:106"/>ſome men think that I did ſubmit to the guilt, as well as to the puniſhment: But I think it is My duty to God firſt, and then to My Countrey, to clear My Self both as an honeſt man, a good King, and a good Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin firſt with My innocency, and in troth, I think it not very needfull for Me to inſiſt long upon this, for all the World knows that I never did begin a War with the two Houſes of Parliament, and I call God to witneſſe, to whom I muſt ſhortly make an account, that I never did intend to incroach upon their Priviledges, they began upon Me; it is the Militia they began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they confeſt that the Militia was Mine, but they thought it fit for to have it from Me; and to be ſhort, if any body will look to the dates of Commiſſions, of their Commiſſions and Mine, and likewiſe to the Declarations, he will ſee clearly that they began theſe unhappy troubles, not I; ſo that as for the guilt of theſe Enormous crimes that are laid againſt Me, I hope that God will clear Me of it: I will not (for I am in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) and God forbid that I ſhould lay it upon the two Houſes of Parliament, there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of either, I hope they are free of this guilt; but I believe that ill Inſtruments between them &amp; Me, have been the chief cauſe of all this blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; ſo that, as I finde My ſelf clear of this, I hope (and pray God) that they may too: yet for all this, God forbid that I ſhould be ſo ill a Chriſtian, as not to ſay that Gods judgements are juſt upon me: Many times he doth pay Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by an unjuſt ſentence, that is ordinary: I will only ſay this, That an unjuſt<note n="*" place="margin">Earl of Strafford.</note> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that I ſuffered for to take effect,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170342:106"/>is puniſhed now, by an unjuſt ſentence upon Me; ſo far I have ſaid, to ſhew you that I am an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man.</p>
            <p>Now for to ſhew you that I am a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: I hope there is<note n="*" place="margin">Poiating to Dr. Juxen B. of London.</note> a good man that will bear Me witneſſe, That I have forgiven all the World; and even thoſe in particular that have been the chief cauſers of My Death; who they are, God knows, I doe not deſire to know, I pray God forgive them.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, My charity muſt goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I wiſh that they may repent, for indeed they have committed a great ſin in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; I pray God with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Stephen, That this be not laid to their charge;</hi> and withall, that they may take the right way to the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for My charity commands Me not only to forgive particular men, but to endeavour to the laſt gaſp, the peace of the Kingdom: So (Sirs) I doe wiſh with all My Soul.<note place="margin">Turning to ſome that wrote.</note> (I ſee there are ſome here will carry it further) that they may endeavour the peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now (Sirs) I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and put you in a way; firſt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet, as far as I could finde by any thing, is in the way of Conqueſt; certainly this is an ill way; for Conqueſt in My opinion is never juſt, except there be a good and a juſt cauſe, either for matter of wrong, or a juſt Title, and then if you goe beyond the firſt quarrel that you have, that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at firſt: For if
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170342:107"/>there be only matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbery; as a Pirate ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, himſelf was but a pety Robber, and ſo, Sirs, I doe think for the way that you are in, you are much out of the way.</p>
            <p>Now Sirs, for to put you in the way, believe it, you will never go right, nor God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſper you, untill you give God his due, the King his due (that is my Succeſſour) and the people their due; I am as much for them as any of you.</p>
            <p>You muſt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church (according to the Scripture) which is now out of order: and to ſet you in a way particularly now I cannot, but only this, A National Synod freely called, freely debating among themſelves, muſt ſettle this, when every opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>
            <p>For the King, Indeed I will not, the Laws of the Land will clearly inſtruct you for that; therefore becauſe it concerns My own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I only give you a touch of it.</p>
            <p>For the people. Truly I deſire their liberty and freedom, as much as any body whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but I muſt tell you, That their liberty and their freedom, conſiſts in having Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under thoſe Laws, by which their Lives and their Goods may be moſt their own. It is not in having a ſhare in the Government, that is nothing pertaining to them. A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things; and therefore, untill you doe that, I mean, That you doe put the people into that liberty as I ſay, certainly they will never enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170342:107"/>
            <p> Sirs, It was for this, that now I am hither come: for if I would have given way to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way, for to have all Laws changed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here; and therefore I tell you, (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) That I am the Martyr of the people.</p>
            <p>In troth Sirs, I ſhall not hold you any longer; I will only ſay this to you, That I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſome little time longer, becauſe I would have put this that I have ſaid in a little better order, and have had it a little better digeſted, then I have done; and therefore I hope you will excuſe Me.</p>
            <p>I have delivered my Conſcience, I pray God, that you doe take thoſe courſes that are beſt for the good of the Kingdom, and your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop of London.</speaker>
               <p>Will your Majeſty (though it be very well known what your Majeſties affections are to Religion, yet becauſe it may be expected, that You ſhould ſay ſomewhat) declare your ſelf for the Worlds ſatisfaction in that point.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>KING.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you very heartily (my Lord) for that I had almoſt forgotten it. In troth Sirs, My Conſcience in Religion, I think, is very well known to all the World; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare before you all, That I die a Chriſtian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the profeſſion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as I found it left to Me by My Father; and this honeſt<note n="*" place="margin">Pointing to the Biſhop.</note> man, I think, will witneſſe it. Then turning to the Officers, He ſaid, Sirs, excuſe Me for this
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170342:108"/>ſame. I have a good cauſe, and I have a gracious God; I will ſay no more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Biſhop of London.</speaker>
               <p>There is but one Stage more, This Stage is turbulent and troubleſome; it is a ſhort one: But You may conſider it will ſoon carry You from Earth to Heaven: and there You ſhall finde a great deal of cordial joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>KING.</speaker>
               <p>I goe from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>The Biſhop.</speaker>
               <p>You are exchanged from a temporal to an eternal Crown; a good exchange.</p>
               <p>Then the King, after ſome ſhort and ſervent ejaculations in private, with hands and eyes lift up to Heaven: immediately ſtooping down, laid His neck upon the Block: And then the Executioner appointed to give the fatal blow, putting His hair under His Cap, the King ſaid, Stay for the ſigne.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>And after a very little pauſe, ſtretching forth His hands, the Executioner at one blow ſevered His Head from His Body, and he changed a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome life for a quiet death.</p>
            <p>His body was put in a Coffin covered with black Velvet, and from thence carried to his Houſe at St. <hi>James's,</hi> where it was put in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin of Lead, laid there to be ſeen by the people. On Wedneſday the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> his Corpſes was delivered to two of his ſervants to be buried at <hi>Windſor;</hi> whether the next day, The Duke of

            <p>King CHARLES 1648.</p>
            <p>which was ſawdred to the breſt of the Corpſe: all things being in readineſſe, the Corpſe was brought to the Vault by the Souldiers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, over which was a black Velvet Hearſe-Cloth, which was ſupported by foure Lords, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſtood weeping by, then was it depoſited in ſilence and ſorrow, the Hearſe-Cloth being caſt in after it.</p>
